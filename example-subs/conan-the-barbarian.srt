2
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:05,105
Between the time
when the oceans drank Atlantis...

3
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:08,942
...and the rise of the sons of Aryas...

4
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,488
...there was an age undreamed of.

5
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,532
And unto this, Conan...

6
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,370
...destined to bear the jeweled crown
of Aquilonia...

7
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:22,206
...upon a troubled brow.

8
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:27,711
It is I, his chronicler,
who alone can tell thee of his saga.

9
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:33,926
Let me tell you of the days
of high adventure.

10
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,591
Fire and wind come from the sky...

11
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,344
...from the gods of the sky.

12
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:27,516
But Crom is your god.
Crom, and he lives in the earth.

13
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,770
Once, giants lived in the earth, Conan.

14
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,859
And in the darkness of chaos,
they fooled Crom...

15
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,029
...and they took from him
the enigma of steel.

16
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:44,033
Crom was angered, and the earth shook.

17
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,368
And fire and wind
struck down these giants...

18
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,204
...and they threw their bodies
into the waters.

19
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,460
But in their rage,
the gods forgot the secret of steel...

20
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,129
...and left it on the battlefield.

21
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,715
And we who found it...

22
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,801
...are just men.

23
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,723
Not gods, not giants.

24
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,558
Just men.

25
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,897
The secret of steel
has always carried with it a mystery.

26
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:19,818
You must learn it, little Conan.
You must learn its discipline.

27
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:25,074
For no one, no one in this world,
can you trust.

28
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:29,036
Not men, not women, not beasts.

29
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,500
This you can trust.

30
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,144
Hyah!

31
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,763
Kill that one!

32
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,372
Kill them! Crush them!

33
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:39,318
The ashes were trampled into the earth...

34
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,404
...and the blood became as snow.

35
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,324
Who knows what they came for?

36
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:49,286
Weapons of steel or murder?

37
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:54,541
It was never known,
for their leader rode to the south...

38
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:59,046
...while children went north
with the Vanir.

39
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:05,803
No one would ever know
that my lord's people had lived at all.

40
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:11,934
His was a tale of sorrow.

41
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,146
Sit here.

42
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,858
Sit here.

43
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,953
He did not care anymore.

44
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,873
Life and death...

45
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,626
...the same.

46
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:15,130
Only that the crowd would
be there to greet him...

47
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:20,135
...with howls of lust and fury.

48
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,890
He began to realize his sense of worth.

49
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,643
He mattered.

50
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:06,932
In time, his victories
could not easily be counted.

51
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,146
He was taken to the East, a great prize...

52
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:17,151
...where the war masters
would teach him the deepest secrets.

53
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:45,220
Language and writing
were made available.

54
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:50,225
The poetry of Khitai,
the philosophy of Sung.

55
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,154
And he also came to know
the pleasures of women...

56
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:07,117
...when he was bred to the finest stock.

57
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:22,609
But always there remained
the discipline of steel.

58
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,830
My fear is that my sons
will never understand me.

59
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,170
We've won again.

60
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,258
This is good. But what is best in life?

61
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,469
The open steppe...

62
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,346
...fleet horse...

63
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:55,184
...falcons at your wrist,
and the wind in your hair.

64
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:59,772
Wrong! Conan, what is best in life?

65
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,858
To crush your enemies,
see them driven before you...

66
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:05,152
...and to hear the lamentation
of their women.

67
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,362
That is good.

68
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:09,239
That is good.

69
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:50,656
Go. Go. You're free.

70
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,412
Go.

71
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,205
It has been surmised...

72
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:01,583
...that perhaps my lord
was like a wild animal...

73
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:04,294
...that had been kept too long.

74
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:06,588
Perhaps, but whatever...

75
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:13,262
...freedom, so long
an unremembered dream, was his.

76
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:15,421
Crom.

77
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,424
There's warmth and fire.

78
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:50,432
Do you not wish to warm yourself
by my fire?

79
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:42,985
They said you would come.

80
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:50,951
From the north, a man of great strength.

81
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:55,372
A conqueror.

82
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,211
A man who would someday be king
by his own hand.

83
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:04,923
One who would crush the snakes
of the earth--

84
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:07,301
Snakes? Did you say snakes?

85
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:17,603
- What is it you seek?
- A standard.

86
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:19,855
A symbol.

87
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:22,232
Perhaps on a shield.

88
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:25,652
Two snakes coming together.

89
00:32:27,197 --> 00:32:29,323
Facing each other...

90
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:30,783
...but they're one.

91
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:35,871
With-- With a sun and a moon below.

92
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:40,501
Black sun, black moon.

93
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:42,836
Yes.

94
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:48,384
There's a price, barbarian.

95
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:55,724
Zamora.

96
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:03,774
Crossroads of the world.

97
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:06,902
You will...

98
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:13,909
...find what you want...

99
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:18,205
...in Zamora.

100
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:24,646
Crom.

101
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:49,630
Food.

102
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:52,466
Food.

103
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:59,348
I have not eaten for days.

104
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:05,938
And who says you will?

105
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:12,778
Give me food so I have strength
when the wolves come.

106
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:16,365
Let me die not in hunger...

107
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,284
...but in combat.

108
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:21,453
Who are you?

109
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:29,044
I am Subotai, thief and archer.

110
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:32,881
I am Hyrkanian,
the great order of Kerlait.

111
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:34,633
So, what are you doing here?

112
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:38,053
Dinner for wolves.

113
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:46,228
What gods do you pray to?

114
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:52,234
I pray to the four winds.

115
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:54,945
And you?

116
00:35:55,113 --> 00:35:56,905
To Crom.

117
00:36:01,953 --> 00:36:04,288
But I seldom pray to him.

118
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:05,831
He doesn't listen.

119
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:10,377
What good is he, then?

120
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:13,422
Eh, it's just as I've always said.

121
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,591
He is strong.

122
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:17,843
If I die, I have to go before him...

123
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:21,764
...and he will ask me,
"What is the riddle of steel?"

124
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:25,100
If I don't know it, he will cast me
out of Valhalla and laugh at me.

125
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:28,437
That's Crom, strong on his mountain.

126
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:33,067
- Eh, my god is greater.
- Heh, heh.

127
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:36,653
Crom laughs at your four winds.
Laughs from his mountain.

128
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:39,406
My god is stronger.

129
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,535
He is the everlasting sky.

130
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:46,789
Your god lives underneath him.

131
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:31,792
Civilization, ancient and wicked.

132
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,336
Have you ever seen this before?

133
00:37:34,504 --> 00:37:37,506
No. Let's waste no time.

134
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:57,651
It's good.

135
00:37:57,819 --> 00:38:00,154
You have no idea
how long it's been there.

136
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:05,034
Stink!

137
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:09,955
Does it always smell like this?
How does the wind ever get in here?

138
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:50,496
How about two snakes
coming together over a black sun?

139
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:52,748
A magnificent standard.

140
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:57,044
The only snakes I know of are those of Set,
in those cursed towers.

141
00:38:57,212 --> 00:38:59,213
They have spread to every city.

142
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:01,840
Two, three years ago,
it was just another snake cult.

143
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:03,592
Now, everywhere.

144
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,971
It is said that they are deceivers.
They murder people in the night.

145
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:10,349
I know nothing.

146
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:12,434
Hey.

147
00:39:17,732 --> 00:39:20,484
Black lotus. Stygian. The best.

148
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:23,237
This better not be Haga.

149
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:26,073
I would sell Haga to a slayer such as you?

150
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:31,203
- A pittance to protect you from evil.
- I am evil. Heh.

151
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:33,747
They're all sluts.

152
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,875
He's dead already.

153
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:44,299
Can you believe that? Huh?

154
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:45,926
- Ah.
- Can you be--?

155
00:39:53,643 --> 00:39:56,478
You're too big to be a thief.

156
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,528
Come. Let's leave this place.

157
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:12,244
You looking for snakes?

158
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:14,830
They live in the Tower of the Serpent.

159
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:19,376
Said to have riches without end
and the greatest jewel of all...

160
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:21,837
...the Eye of the Serpent.

161
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:26,008
Chew it slowly. It's the good stuff.

162
00:41:06,716 --> 00:41:10,386
- You are not a guard.
- Neither are you.

163
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:13,514
We're thieves, heh, like yourself.

164
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:18,352
- Come to climb the tower.
- You don't even have a rope.

165
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:24,066
Two fools who laugh at death.

166
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:27,027
Do you know what horrors
lie beyond that wall?

167
00:41:27,904 --> 00:41:29,613
No.

168
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:33,909
Then you go first.

169
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:25,085
- What on earth could smell so bad?
- Do you wanna live forever?

170
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:07,836
That one.

171
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:10,839
He's the high priest,
second only to Thulsa Doom.

172
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:13,842
They say Thulsa Doom's
a thousand years old.

173
00:43:18,723 --> 00:43:21,016
I'll see what's here.
Go find out what's below.

174
00:47:41,569 --> 00:47:42,778
Infidel!

175
00:47:57,127 --> 00:47:59,461
Infidels!

176
00:48:23,194 --> 00:48:24,278
Kill them!

177
00:48:28,825 --> 00:48:30,451
Do you wanna live forever?

178
00:52:30,483 --> 00:52:36,739
All manner of pleasures
and diversions were indulged.

179
00:52:36,906 --> 00:52:39,533
Wealth can be wonderful.

180
00:52:41,411 --> 00:52:45,831
But you know,
success can test one's mettle...

181
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:51,086
...as surely as the strongest adversary.

182
00:53:14,569 --> 00:53:20,115
They were taken to the hall
of King Osric, the Usurper.

183
00:53:20,283 --> 00:53:24,286
Once a powerful Northman like my lord...

184
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:27,748
...but now old and sotted.

185
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:35,130
These are the thieves
you have requested, sire.

186
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:37,299
I thought there were three.

187
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:42,471
Uh, our companion, he died in the gardens.
Lions ate him.

188
00:53:43,014 --> 00:53:44,306
Lions ate him?

189
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:54,608
Lions ate him.

190
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:06,161
You know what you've done?

191
00:54:08,581 --> 00:54:14,128
Why, Rexor himself has come before me,
threatened me, the king.

192
00:54:14,295 --> 00:54:19,508
What daring! What outrageousness!
What insolence! What arrogance!

193
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:29,768
I salute you.

194
00:54:36,026 --> 00:54:41,905
Thulsa Doom.
I've chafed for years at this demigod.

195
00:54:42,073 --> 00:54:45,576
Snakes in my beautiful city.

196
00:54:45,744 --> 00:54:50,789
To the west, Nemedia, Aquilonia.
To the south, Koth, Stygia.

197
00:54:50,957 --> 00:54:55,044
Snakes. Everywhere, these evil towers.

198
00:54:55,211 --> 00:54:59,631
You alone have stood up to their guards.
And what are you?

199
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:01,300
Thieves.

200
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:09,808
You see this?

201
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:14,730
They call it the Fangs of the Serpent.

202
00:55:14,898 --> 00:55:19,068
And this one was thrust
into a father's heart...

203
00:55:19,235 --> 00:55:21,612
...by his very son.

204
00:55:22,655 --> 00:55:28,744
And my own daughter has fallen
under this Thulsa Doom's spell.

205
00:55:30,413 --> 00:55:35,334
Is there a dagger such as this
in her hand for me?

206
00:55:37,629 --> 00:55:40,130
She follows him as a slave...

207
00:55:40,298 --> 00:55:43,592
...seeking for the truth of her soul...

208
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,512
...as if I could not give it to her.

209
00:55:53,395 --> 00:55:58,691
As we speak, my daughter travels east...

210
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:03,237
...to Thulsa Doom
and his Mountain of Power.

211
00:56:04,114 --> 00:56:07,408
She is to be his.

212
00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:20,212
Steal my daughter back.
Take all you can carry.

213
00:56:24,884 --> 00:56:30,055
There's more. There's much more.
Enough to become kings yourselves.

214
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:40,941
There comes a time, thief,
when the jewels cease to sparkle...

215
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:44,361
...when the gold loses its luster...

216
00:56:44,529 --> 00:56:47,823
...when the throne room
becomes a prison...

217
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:54,830
...and all that is left
is a father's love for his child.

218
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:04,298
To the hellfires with Thulsa Doom.
He's evil.

219
00:57:04,466 --> 00:57:07,676
A sorcerer who can summon demons.

220
00:57:08,178 --> 00:57:12,848
His followers' only purpose
is to die in his service.

221
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:16,393
Thousands of them.

222
00:57:17,062 --> 00:57:21,482
This Mountain of Power where he lives
is said to be impregnable.

223
00:57:23,568 --> 00:57:27,196
I have talked to Subotai and he agrees.

224
00:57:27,364 --> 00:57:30,366
Let's take what we have while we live.

225
00:57:39,584 --> 00:57:42,878
I have never had so much as now.

226
00:57:44,172 --> 00:57:47,049
All my life, I've been alone.

227
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:53,389
Many times I've faced my death
with no one to know.

228
00:57:55,892 --> 00:57:59,561
I would look into the huts and the tents
of others in the coldest dark...

229
00:57:59,729 --> 00:58:03,565
...and I would see figures
holding each other in the night.

230
00:58:05,735 --> 00:58:08,320
But I always passed by.

231
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:16,578
You and I, we have warmth.

232
00:58:16,746 --> 00:58:19,790
That's so hard to find in this world.

233
00:58:21,626 --> 00:58:27,006
Please, let someone else pass by
in the night.

234
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:32,928
Let us take the world by the throat
and make it give us what we desire.

235
01:00:55,905 --> 01:01:01,493
The children of Doom. Doom's children.

236
01:01:01,661 --> 01:01:06,331
They told my lord the way
to the Mountain of Power.

237
01:01:06,499 --> 01:01:12,588
They told him to throw down his sword
and return to the earth.

238
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:19,803
Time enough for the earth in the grave.

239
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:28,372
Ooh.

240
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:34,420
Once, great men lived here. Giants, gods.

241
01:02:34,587 --> 01:02:36,338
Once, but long ago.

242
01:02:44,347 --> 01:02:47,433
It was here that I met my master.

243
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,144
It was no accident...

244
01:02:50,311 --> 01:02:56,817
...nor is it mere chance
that I am the teller of his tale.

245
01:02:58,695 --> 01:02:59,695
Hey!

246
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:05,617
I'm a wizard, mind you.

247
01:03:05,785 --> 01:03:11,331
This place is kept by powerful gods
and spirits of kings.

248
01:03:11,499 --> 01:03:15,669
Harm my flesh
and you will have to deal with the dead.

249
01:03:16,379 --> 01:03:18,464
Can you summon demons, wizard?

250
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:21,967
Yes! I strike at you.

251
01:03:22,135 --> 01:03:26,055
I would summon a demon more ferocious
than all in hell.

252
01:03:44,074 --> 01:03:48,327
Mounds have been here
since the time of the Titans.

253
01:03:48,703 --> 01:03:52,247
Kings buried in them, great kings.

254
01:03:52,415 --> 01:03:57,336
Domains once glittered like the light
on the windy sea.

255
01:03:58,088 --> 01:04:02,633
Fire won't burn there. No fire at all.

256
01:04:02,801 --> 01:04:05,928
That's why I live down here in the wind.

257
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:09,014
Do you care for these places?

258
01:04:09,182 --> 01:04:13,560
I sing to them on nights when they wish.

259
01:04:13,728 --> 01:04:19,441
I sing of the tales of battles, heroes,
witches and women.

260
01:04:20,068 --> 01:04:22,277
Nobody bothers me down here.

261
01:04:22,445 --> 01:04:25,906
Not even Thulsa Doom.

262
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:31,704
Do flowers grow around here?

263
01:04:32,622 --> 01:04:34,331
Flowers?

264
01:04:43,174 --> 01:04:44,800
Flowers.

265
01:04:45,885 --> 01:04:48,846
You've not come here
as a pilgrim, have you?

266
01:04:49,014 --> 01:04:52,224
Oil the sword and feed the horse.

267
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:54,977
Have you ever ridden
one of those things before?

268
01:04:57,522 --> 01:04:58,981
No!

269
01:05:01,568 --> 01:05:05,863
Warrior, what are the flowers for?

270
01:05:06,031 --> 01:05:07,072
For a girl.

271
01:05:31,264 --> 01:05:34,266
Doom, Doom, Doom.

272
01:05:45,945 --> 01:05:49,323
Doom.

273
01:05:50,867 --> 01:05:59,166
Doom.

274
01:07:06,359 --> 01:07:08,819
Where do you think you're going,
brother?

275
01:07:08,987 --> 01:07:10,738
I am afraid.

276
01:07:10,905 --> 01:07:15,534
Afraid to bare yourself? Why?

277
01:07:15,702 --> 01:07:18,412
You're so big and so well grown.

278
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:21,040
You should be proud of your body.

279
01:07:21,207 --> 01:07:26,128
How do you expect to reach emptiness
without knowing your own body?

280
01:07:26,921 --> 01:07:29,548
Could we talk over there...

281
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:32,134
...where the others cannot see?

282
01:07:32,302 --> 01:07:36,889
Why, yes, brother. Of course.

283
01:07:49,986 --> 01:07:53,030
I am afraid and I am shy.

284
01:07:55,033 --> 01:07:57,743
Is this, uh, your robe?

285
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:00,287
Priest's robe?

286
01:08:00,455 --> 01:08:03,165
Yes, it's all I have.

287
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:04,875
Good.

288
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:11,507
That's all you'll ever need.

289
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,387
Brother.

290
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:03,786
What do you see?

291
01:10:04,454 --> 01:10:07,039
Uh, infinity.

292
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:09,541
Good.

293
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:22,823
I see you.

294
01:11:24,993 --> 01:11:27,703
I have watched you.

295
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:32,249
For a thousand years,
I have watched you.

296
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:35,878
Doom.

297
01:11:36,629 --> 01:11:43,886
Doom.

298
01:11:58,777 --> 01:12:02,654
Who among you still fears death?

299
01:12:03,406 --> 01:12:06,700
Who will not face emptiness?

300
01:12:07,744 --> 01:12:09,536
- Infidel!
- Infidel!

301
01:13:09,139 --> 01:13:11,432
I wish to speak to you now.

302
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:22,484
Where is the Eye of the Serpent?

303
01:13:26,322 --> 01:13:29,908
Rexor says that you gave it to a girl.

304
01:13:30,368 --> 01:13:34,163
Probably for a mere night's pleasure.
Hmm?

305
01:13:35,081 --> 01:13:37,249
What a loss.

306
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:41,962
People have no grasp of what they do.

307
01:13:43,381 --> 01:13:47,801
You broke into my house,
stole my property...

308
01:13:47,969 --> 01:13:50,804
...murdered my servants and my pets.

309
01:13:50,972 --> 01:13:54,308
And that is what grieves me the most.

310
01:13:55,185 --> 01:13:57,936
You killed my snake.

311
01:13:58,104 --> 01:14:02,024
Thorgrim is beside himself with grief.

312
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:08,447
He raised that snake
from the time it was born.

313
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:14,870
You killed my mother.

314
01:14:15,038 --> 01:14:18,123
You killed my father.
You killed my people!

315
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:20,334
You took my father's sword.

316
01:14:23,713 --> 01:14:25,172
Ah.

317
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:28,050
It must have been when I was younger.

318
01:14:28,885 --> 01:14:32,680
There was a time, boy,
when I searched for steel.

319
01:14:32,847 --> 01:14:37,309
When steel meant more to me
than gold or jewels.

320
01:14:38,853 --> 01:14:41,814
The riddle of steel.

321
01:14:42,607 --> 01:14:44,233
Yes.

322
01:14:44,401 --> 01:14:46,819
You know what it is, don't you, boy?

323
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:51,990
Shall I tell you? It's the least I can do.

324
01:14:53,743 --> 01:14:59,164
Steel isn't strong, boy. Flesh is stronger.

325
01:14:59,332 --> 01:15:00,374
Look around you.

326
01:15:03,837 --> 01:15:05,963
There, on the rocks.

327
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:10,342
That beautiful girl.

328
01:15:11,094 --> 01:15:13,303
Come to me, my child.

329
01:15:23,231 --> 01:15:25,983
That is strength, boy.

330
01:15:26,151 --> 01:15:28,277
That is power.

331
01:15:28,445 --> 01:15:31,780
The strength and power of flesh.

332
01:15:31,948 --> 01:15:35,951
What is steel
compared to the hand that wields it?

333
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:40,581
Look at the strength of your body,
the desire in your heart.

334
01:15:40,749 --> 01:15:43,876
I gave you this.

335
01:15:44,044 --> 01:15:46,295
Such a waste.

336
01:15:49,299 --> 01:15:52,426
Contemplate this on the Tree of Woe.

337
01:15:58,683 --> 01:16:01,310
Crucify him.

338
01:19:01,866 --> 01:19:03,283
He said you were a wizard.

339
01:19:05,245 --> 01:19:07,246
Do the gods owe you any favors?

340
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:15,838
There are dangers,
but I see you care little for those.

341
01:19:16,006 --> 01:19:19,049
The spirits of this place
extract a heavy toll.

342
01:19:19,217 --> 01:19:20,843
Then I will pay them.

343
01:20:16,983 --> 01:20:18,525
Drink.

344
01:20:26,076 --> 01:20:31,580
Sometime soon, perhaps tonight,
they'll try to take him.

345
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:36,210
- And if they succeed--
- If they succeed, you'll follow.

346
01:22:08,011 --> 01:22:11,305
No! No!

347
01:22:23,151 --> 01:22:24,902
No!

348
01:22:35,872 --> 01:22:39,249
Stop! Stop!

349
01:23:08,697 --> 01:23:09,738
They're gone.

350
01:23:12,826 --> 01:23:14,868
They're gone!

351
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:11,133
All the gods, they cannot sever us.

352
01:24:11,301 --> 01:24:16,055
If I were dead and you still fighting for life,
I'd come back from the darkness...

353
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:21,852
...back from the pit of hell
to fight at your side.

354
01:25:35,719 --> 01:25:39,304
The old man says
the Mountain of Power is hollow.

355
01:25:40,056 --> 01:25:42,558
Thulsa Doom lives in the mountain.

356
01:25:43,643 --> 01:25:45,519
What else does he say?

357
01:25:46,062 --> 01:25:49,231
That in the back of the mountain,
there's a gorge.

358
01:25:49,858 --> 01:25:50,983
Many caves.

359
01:25:52,444 --> 01:25:54,737
A thief could get in there,
steal the princess...

360
01:25:54,904 --> 01:25:57,906
...and be off before she's missed
in the darkness.

361
01:25:58,074 --> 01:26:01,744
Good thieves could do that,
but not vengeful ones.

362
01:26:05,248 --> 01:26:09,835
Only the girl.
We kill Thulsa Doom another day.

363
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:15,382
Agreed?

364
01:26:17,886 --> 01:26:19,511
Conan?

365
01:31:10,929 --> 01:31:13,472
So this is paradise.

366
01:31:20,313 --> 01:31:22,189
Princess.

367
01:35:23,056 --> 01:35:24,807
Get them!

368
01:35:40,448 --> 01:35:42,324
Come on!

369
01:35:50,834 --> 01:35:52,292
You.

370
01:38:06,636 --> 01:38:08,429
Help him.

371
01:38:14,978 --> 01:38:17,604
The infidel defilers...

372
01:38:18,648 --> 01:38:21,984
...they shall all drown in lakes of blood.

373
01:38:22,152 --> 01:38:26,113
Now they will know
why they are afraid of the dark.

374
01:38:26,281 --> 01:38:30,451
Now they will learn
why they fear the night.

375
01:39:04,402 --> 01:39:06,612
Seek.

376
01:39:56,746 --> 01:40:02,084
The wizard.
I told him I would pay the gods.

377
01:40:18,685 --> 01:40:20,644
Hold me.

378
01:40:23,273 --> 01:40:27,609
Kiss me.

379
01:40:33,033 --> 01:40:36,785
Let me breathe my last breath
into your mouth.

380
01:40:38,455 --> 01:40:40,789
I�m so cold.

381
01:40:46,463 --> 01:40:48,756
So cold.

382
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:54,386
Keep me...

383
01:40:56,473 --> 01:40:58,140
...warm.

384
01:41:01,478 --> 01:41:03,312
Keep...

385
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,274
...me....

386
01:42:05,041 --> 01:42:10,212
Hey. Fire won't burn up there.
No fire at all.

387
01:42:47,417 --> 01:42:49,209
Why do you cry?

388
01:42:50,712 --> 01:42:54,173
He is Conan, Cimmerian.

389
01:42:54,924 --> 01:42:56,842
He won't cry.

390
01:42:58,762 --> 01:43:01,055
So I cry for him.

391
01:44:26,474 --> 01:44:29,685
He will kill you. He has seen your fires.

392
01:44:29,894 --> 01:44:33,856
He will come for me,
and when he does, he will kill you.

393
01:44:48,663 --> 01:44:53,709
I remember days like this
when my father took me to the forest...

394
01:44:53,877 --> 01:44:56,545
...and we ate wild blueberries.

395
01:44:57,005 --> 01:44:59,715
More than 20 years ago.

396
01:44:59,883 --> 01:45:03,385
I was just a boy of 4 or 5.

397
01:45:04,846 --> 01:45:07,973
The leaves were so dark and green then.

398
01:45:08,892 --> 01:45:12,853
The grass smelled sweet
with the spring wind.

399
01:45:16,816 --> 01:45:19,735
Almost 20 years of pitiless combat.

400
01:45:19,903 --> 01:45:23,530
No rest, no sleep like other men.

401
01:45:24,366 --> 01:45:27,534
And yet the spring wind blows, Subotai.

402
01:45:28,328 --> 01:45:30,162
Have you ever felt such a wind?

403
01:45:31,206 --> 01:45:33,707
They blow where I live too.

404
01:45:36,044 --> 01:45:38,754
In the north of every man's heart.

405
01:45:41,341 --> 01:45:43,384
It�s never too late, Subotai.

406
01:45:44,052 --> 01:45:46,011
No.

407
01:45:48,223 --> 01:45:51,558
It would only lead me back here
another day.

408
01:45:53,937 --> 01:45:55,771
In even worse company.

409
01:46:02,904 --> 01:46:06,115
For us, there is no spring.

410
01:46:06,616 --> 01:46:11,370
Just the wind that smells fresh
before the storm.

411
01:46:59,502 --> 01:47:02,338
Hey, old man.
Where'd you get this stuff?

412
01:47:02,505 --> 01:47:03,672
The dead.

413
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:08,427
The gods are pleased with you.
They will watch the battle. Heh.

414
01:47:08,595 --> 01:47:11,221
- Are they going to help?
- No. Ha, ha.

415
01:47:11,389 --> 01:47:14,350
- Well, then tell them to stay out of the way.
- Aah! Ha-ha-ha.

416
01:48:42,022 --> 01:48:43,981
Crom...

417
01:48:44,441 --> 01:48:47,317
...I have never prayed to you before.

418
01:48:47,902 --> 01:48:49,778
I have no tongue for it.

419
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:55,909
No one, not even you,
will remember if we were good men or bad.

420
01:48:56,077 --> 01:48:59,038
Why we fought or why we died.

421
01:48:59,205 --> 01:49:00,456
No.

422
01:49:00,623 --> 01:49:04,418
All that matters
is that two stood against many.

423
01:49:04,586 --> 01:49:06,587
That's what's important.

424
01:49:06,963 --> 01:49:12,426
Valor pleases you, Crom,
so grant me one request.

425
01:49:13,386 --> 01:49:16,263
Grant me revenge.

426
01:49:16,848 --> 01:49:21,602
And if you do not listen,
then to hell with you.

427
01:51:51,628 --> 01:51:52,628
Hyah!

428
01:52:46,307 --> 01:52:49,810
- That's how we do it.
- I did it. With my spear.

429
01:54:00,757 --> 01:54:02,508
Do you wanna live forever?

430
01:54:56,646 --> 01:54:58,772
Doom!

431
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:02,026
Don't leave me! My lord!

432
01:55:10,201 --> 01:55:12,661
No, don't kill me!

433
01:55:18,835 --> 01:55:21,337
Father!

434
01:56:28,530 --> 01:56:31,615
Doom.

435
01:56:32,158 --> 01:56:38,831
Doom.

436
01:57:45,231 --> 01:57:48,484
The purging is at last at hand.

437
01:57:48,651 --> 01:57:51,153
The day of doom is here.

438
01:57:56,159 --> 01:57:59,787
All that is evil, all that have eyes...

439
01:57:59,996 --> 01:58:02,581
...your parents, your leaders...

440
01:58:02,749 --> 01:58:06,794
...those who would call themselves
your judges.

441
01:58:06,961 --> 01:58:09,838
Those who have lied...

442
01:58:10,006 --> 01:58:12,675
...and corrupted the earth.

443
01:58:12,842 --> 01:58:15,469
They shall all be cleansed.

444
01:58:15,637 --> 01:58:19,556
Doom.

445
01:58:19,724 --> 01:58:22,601
You, my children, are the water...

446
01:58:23,186 --> 01:58:27,356
...that will wash away
all that has gone before.

447
01:58:27,524 --> 01:58:31,276
In your hand you hold my light...

448
01:58:31,444 --> 01:58:34,363
...a gleam in the eye of Set.

449
01:58:34,531 --> 01:58:38,701
This flame will burn away the darkness...

450
01:58:39,202 --> 01:58:43,372
...burn you away to paradise!

451
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:45,791
Doom.

452
01:58:48,044 --> 01:58:55,467
Doom.

453
01:59:19,659 --> 01:59:21,785
My child.

454
01:59:22,370 --> 01:59:25,330
You have come to me, my son.

455
01:59:26,916 --> 01:59:30,377
For who now is your father
if it is not me?

456
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:34,340
Who gave you the will to live?

457
01:59:36,384 --> 01:59:40,929
I am the wellspring from which you flow.

458
01:59:42,307 --> 01:59:44,641
When I am gone...

459
01:59:45,268 --> 01:59:48,062
...you will have never been.

460
01:59:49,189 --> 01:59:54,068
What will your world be without me?

461
01:59:57,614 --> 02:00:05,287
My son.

462
02:00:06,305 --> 02:01:06,150
