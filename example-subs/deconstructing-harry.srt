2
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,669
I could never
get those fires started.

3
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:58,430
Dad, are you gonna have chicken?
You want meat?

4
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,749
Chicken's fine.

5
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:01,229
This is a brilliant article.

6
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,329
Norman!

7
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,629
Did you read
Ken's article on China?

8
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:06,589
- No, I haven't.
- Terrific article.

9
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:07,869
Where is Ken?

10
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:10,589
In the house
watching the Yankee game.

11
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:13,829
Your husband. Comes for a day
in the beautiful countryside...

12
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:16,069
heads for the television set.

13
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,949
Ken, come on, honey!

14
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:20,510
How many people want chicken,
and how many want hamburgers?

15
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,829
Two more outs! Three minutes!

16
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:25,229
I think everybody's dying
for a little libation.

17
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:27,609
Why don't you make
your famous Stoli martinis?

18
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:30,670
Janet, when are you and Ken
gonna have a child?

19
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,349
You've let your sister
have a big head start.

20
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:35,909
Let Leslie practice viola
for six hours a day...

21
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:37,510
then it's not so easy.

22
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,259
Leave her alone.

23
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:50,500
I came in here to make drinks
for everybody.

24
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:54,939
What are you doing?
You want a drink?

25
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,860
Sure.

26
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,540
This is nuts.

27
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,540
We gotta get out of here.

28
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,060
Oh, God.

29
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,029
We're gonna get caught.

30
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:27,139
They're by the lake.
I can see everything.

31
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,380
They're deep in conversation.

32
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,339
Wait! There's Janet!

33
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,780
Ken...

34
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:56,469
You can't scare me like that.
I grind my teeth.

35
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,629
Just don't scare me like that.

36
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:00,309
It was nothing.
Just a false alarm.

37
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:02,710
Try not to actually chew.

38
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,909
Wouldn't it be great
if we could be alone together?

39
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:07,389
Just relaxed, you and me?

40
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:08,829
It would be so great.

41
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:10,269
That would be so great.

42
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:12,789
Let's hang in. You never know
what's gonna happen.

43
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:13,909
Come on. Open wide.

44
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:18,389
Ken, turn the Yankee game off
and come on out here now!

45
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:21,260
I will! Just one minute!
It's almost over!

46
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,269
God. I'm done.

47
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,350
You can come anytime you want.

48
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,450
Can I?

49
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,540
I'm ready!

50
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,660
Leslie, is that you?

51
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,809
Can you lead me
down to the lake?

52
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,869
Can you give me just a minute,
Grandma?

53
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:51,429
I'm just...I'm making martinis.

54
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:53,030
Sure, dear.

55
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,469
I want to finish.

56
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:55,749
Oh, Ken?

57
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:56,940
Is that you?

58
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:58,619
Finish what?

59
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,269
Come, Ken.

60
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,629
Come?

61
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:05,629
Come lead me down to the lake.

62
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:10,059
Ever since I lost my second eye,
I feel so frail.

63
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:14,869
You don't have to moan about it.

64
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:16,949
It's not that terrible.

65
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:18,909
Ken is hurrying, Grandma.

66
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:21,509
Would you do the olives, Ken?
Quickly?

67
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:24,030
Oh, you know,
you can use onions, too.

68
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,260
I prefer onions, don't you, Ken?

69
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,740
Boy, you must really love
onions.

70
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,300
How much do I...

71
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,909
Lucy?

72
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:45,430
You schmuck! You bastard!

73
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,140
I'd like to cut your head off.

74
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,060
You're upset, right?

75
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,030
How could you? Didn't you know
what would happen?

76
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,709
What?

77
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:56,029
Don't answer me, prick.

78
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:58,750
You knew.
You just didn't give a shit.

79
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,669
Why don't you take
your coat off and just...

80
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:03,550
How could you write that book?

81
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,829
Are you so selfish?

82
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:07,549
You're so self-engrossed
you don't care who you destroy?

83
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:10,659
You told our whole story!

84
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:13,869
All the details.
You gave me away to my sister.

85
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:16,100
Marvin's left me. He's gone.

86
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:19,069
It was loosely based on us.

87
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:21,700
Don't bullshit me, motherfucker!

88
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:23,549
Who do you think
you're talking to...

89
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,700
one of those retarded
talk-show hosts?

90
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,989
I lived through it with you.

91
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,909
I know how loosely based it is.

92
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:32,829
Hey, what are you telling me...

93
00:06:32,929 --> 00:06:36,019
that your blind grandmother
caught us fucking one day?

94
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:38,149
No, No. Of course.

95
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:40,509
You made a few
stupid exaggerations...

96
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:44,069
or, as the critics say,
"inspired comic flights."

97
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,190
But Jane recognized it.

98
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,110
You'd have to be submental
not to.

99
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,190
And Marvin was crushed!

100
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,469
Jane suspected us.

101
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:53,549
I can't tell you how long
Jane suspected us.

102
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,469
I know! I denied it!

103
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:56,910
And now you've gone...

104
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,459
you've gone
and confirmed it all for her.

105
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,109
Big fuckin' deal...
you made Leslie shorter.

106
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:04,710
Big fuckin' deal!

107
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,939
But it's all here.

108
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,669
The poor schmuck country doctor,
the violinist...

109
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:12,980
her younger sister
cheating with her husband.

110
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:15,860
The picture window,
for Christ's sake!

111
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:18,349
Cruel observations
about Marvin...

112
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:20,420
with his barbecue
and chef's hat.

113
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:22,349
And, of course, Jane...

114
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:26,140
or, as you pathetically
disguise her...

115
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:27,739
Janet.

116
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,860
Here it is.

117
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:33,849
"It was not simply that Leslie
had become numbed..."

118
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:35,990
"with the inane spate
of leaden perceptions..."

119
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,509
"that passed for wit
from Marvin."

120
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:41,350
"It was not even the image
she shared with Ken..."

121
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,869
"of Marvin's flaccid,
microscopic member..."

122
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:47,110
"jiggling up and down
as he bounced naked..."

123
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,449
"across the icy floor
of their Connecticut home..."

124
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:52,100
"to close the storm windows."

125
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,019
"It was that she
had never loved him..."

126
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:57,670
"but wanted to have children..."

127
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,749
"to retaliate against
her older sister..."

128
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:01,989
"who did not have
a maternal bone in her being..."

129
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:03,909
"and whose every inch,
Leslie felt..."

130
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:06,549
"was occupied
by gluttonous self-love."

131
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:09,190
"Ken ran his hand over
Leslie's large round breasts..."

132
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,629
"and mounted her from the rear."

133
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:12,709
Big fuckin' deal.
You gave her large breasts.

134
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:14,149
Leslie, please...

135
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:15,300
Lucy!

136
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,100
I'm Lucy, motherfucker!

137
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,339
Not Leslie.

138
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:26,389
Except, of course,
I am Leslie...

139
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:29,029
because you made no attempt
to disguise anything.

140
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:30,430
You didn't give a fuck!

141
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,709
You didn't care enough
to disguise anything!

142
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:34,150
Please! Jesus!

143
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,869
You pulled out two years ago.

144
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:37,669
You broke my fuckin' heart.

145
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:40,310
You left your wife and me...

146
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,390
for some little cooze!

147
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,940
Me and Janet!

148
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,459
Jane. Janet is the character.

149
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,140
Now, two years on...

150
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,469
your latest magnum opus...

151
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:56,189
emerges from this sewer
of an apartment...

152
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:57,789
where you take
everyone's suffering...

153
00:08:57,889 --> 00:08:59,510
and turn it into gold.

154
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,109
Literary gold.

155
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:03,789
Everyone's misery.
You even cause them misery.

156
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:06,429
Mix your alchemy
and make it into gold...

157
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:08,629
like some fuckin'
black magician!

158
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:09,749
Give me a break.

159
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,990
I'm the one who wound up
in Bellevue.

160
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,910
- You deserve it and worse.
- Lucy!

161
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,109
You've ruined my life!

162
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:16,790
I've come here
to blow my brains out!

163
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,910
What's wrong with you?

164
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,549
In front of you on your carpet
because you caused it.

165
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:23,029
My fuckin' brains
on your carpet!

166
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,949
You're so fucking unstable!
Will you relax?

167
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:27,029
That's why you picked me.

168
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:28,949
That's what turns you on
about me...

169
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:30,069
Jane's crazy sister.

170
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,340
Calm down.
You're not gonna kill yourself.

171
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,030
No, you're not,
because it's not in you.

172
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,910
You're not the dramatic type.
You never were.

173
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,829
Jane is the dramatic sister.

174
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:41,980
Jane is the solo violinist.

175
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,940
Relax. For Christ's sake.

176
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,700
You're right.

177
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,340
I don't have the nerve
to kill myself.

178
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:57,980
I knew it as I came over here.

179
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:02,619
I said, no, not me.

180
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,380
Better...

181
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:08,700
to kill him.

182
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:11,110
Pardon me?

183
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,349
Kill the black magician...

184
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:17,069
so he can't spin any more gold
out of human misery.

185
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:18,670
What's wrong with you?

186
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,590
- Shut up!
- Put it down!

187
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,869
You're so fuckin' verbal!

188
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:24,629
Who else could have talked me
into giving him a blow job...

189
00:10:24,729 --> 00:10:26,269
at my father's funeral?

190
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:27,369
Lucy, think it over.

191
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,909
You stop right there!

192
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:33,989
Don't shoot!
Don't pull the trigger.

193
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:37,310
Look, If it makes you happy,
my life has been going badly.

194
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,110
I've been miserable.
My girl left me.

195
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,820
She went off
with a close friend of mine.

196
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,189
Insomnia. I've got herpes.

197
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:44,629
I've squandered
everything I have

198
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:47,470
on shrinks and lawyers
and whores.

199
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,710
...fatigue syndrome.

200
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,590
I'm not gonna stand up here
on this fucking roof...

201
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,590
with a world-class
meshugana cunt...

202
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,650
and beg for my life.

203
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,050
If you want to, shoot me.

204
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,469
I was working. You interrupted.

205
00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:00,789
So whose life
were you exploiting today?

206
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:01,989
You'll be very happy...

207
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:04,750
I was working on
an autobiographical thing...

208
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,619
about when I was first married.

209
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:10,309
<i>Harvey Stern married too young...</i>

210
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:12,229
<i>mainly to get out</i>
<i>of his parents' apartment...</i>

211
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:14,229
<i>which was</i>
<i>a rent-controlled cornucopia...</i>

212
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:17,709
<i>of guilt, antagonism,</i>
<i>and soul-deadening criticism.</i>

213
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:20,589
<i>By day, he labored listlessly</i>
<i>in a shoe store.</i>

214
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:24,140
<i>By night, he glowed intensely</i>
<i>over his Remington portable.</i>

215
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,419
Are you coming to bed?

216
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:30,429
Rosalee, I'm in the middle
of a sentence...

217
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:34,149
I'm feeling rejected because
we never sleep together anymore.

218
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:37,069
I don't know what it is.
I'm just not attracted to her.

219
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:38,630
Is she doing something
to put you off?

220
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,669
It's my fault, too.

221
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:43,869
And I lie. I tell her
I'm too wrapped up in work...

222
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,309
but the opposite is true.

223
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:48,209
I'm hyper-sexually aroused,
just not for her.

224
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:50,669
- Who for?
- Anyone else.

225
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:53,310
<i>She has a sister.</i>
<i>I'm dying to fuck her.</i>

226
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,309
<i>A doll. Thick lips.</i>

227
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:57,830
<i>Her friend from Columbia.</i>
<i>Jennifer? I dream of her.</i>

228
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,990
<i>I never thought I could care</i>
<i>about African history...</i>

229
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,509
<i>but she's spellbinding.</i>

230
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:04,229
<i>The truth is,</i>
<i>I never meet or see a woman...</i>

231
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:07,139
<i>that I don't wonder what it</i>
<i>would be like in bed with her.</i>

232
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:12,379
I met a great hooker.

233
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:14,269
A hooker?

234
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:15,709
Yeah. Beautiful.

235
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:17,310
From China.

236
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,709
Unbelievable body.

237
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:23,509
Schooled by tradition
in the art of pleasing men.

238
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,020
It's 50 clams.

239
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:27,909
Wouldn't you be cheating
on your wife?

240
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:30,509
It's not cheating.
She's a hooker.

241
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:32,659
It's not like
I'm having a love affair.

242
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,469
You don't feel
for a professional girl...

243
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:37,309
the way you do for your wife.

244
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:39,589
She comes over,
rubs on her oils...

245
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:40,820
Oils?

246
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:43,949
Into the sack,
she takes you to the moon.

247
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:46,580
You lay half a C-note on her,
and she's history.

248
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,189
Where would you do it?

249
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:51,829
I couldn't have her come
to my apartment.

250
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:52,989
Get a hotel room.

251
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:55,139
That's what I do
when the wife's home.

252
00:12:57,859 --> 00:13:00,629
I don't have that kind of dough.
Fifty's a lot in itself.

253
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:03,149
Maybe a friend
will let you use his place.

254
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,189
Kid, you're always bitchin'
about your sex life.

255
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:07,540
I'm trying to help.

256
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:10,989
I tell her
you gave me the number?

257
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:13,189
No, no. Not my name.

258
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:14,949
Don't use your real name.

259
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:16,629
No, of course.
Not the real name.

260
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,109
Tell you what you do.
You borrow a friend's apartment.

261
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:22,100
You use his name.
That way, it'll be on the bell.

262
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,470
<i>Now good fortune</i>
<i>smiled on Harvey...</i>

263
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,070
<i>as one of his closest friends,</i>
<i>Mendel Birnbaum...</i>

264
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,509
<i>was hit by a car...</i>

265
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,829
<i>and lay hovering</i>
<i>between life and death...</i>

266
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:33,229
<i>at New York hospital...</i>

267
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:37,349
<i>thus freeing up an apartment</i>
<i>for Harvey's tryst.</i>

268
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,750
<i>Donning the other man's</i>
<i>silk robe...</i>

269
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,189
<i>Harvey became the swinger</i>
<i>Mendel Birnbaum...</i>

270
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:46,789
<i>and awaited his Oriental</i>
<i>passport to paradise.</i>

271
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:49,219
You must be Mendel Birnbaum.

272
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,229
Did you enjoy it?

273
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:12,950
Are you kidding?
I'll be right back.

274
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,149
Where you going?

275
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:17,029
I'm gonna see
if I can find another 50.

276
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:18,500
I'd like to go again.

277
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,710
Open.

278
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,459
Who is it?

279
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,989
Who are you?

280
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:49,469
I've come for you.

281
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:50,790
What are you talking about?

282
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,949
I'm Death,
and your name is on my list.

283
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:58,929
No, no, no. Wait a minute.
You've made a mistake.

284
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:01,149
You don't have a minute.

285
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:02,549
I'm not Mendel Birnb...

286
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:05,349
Don't give me that bullshit!

287
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:07,229
Look at your monogram.

288
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:10,029
Mendel, who are you talking to?

289
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:11,349
Stop calling me Mendel.

290
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:12,629
I'm just using his pad.

291
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:13,749
Right.

292
00:15:13,849 --> 00:15:16,349
They always have an excuse.

293
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:17,469
Let's go.

294
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:20,019
Move it, you little putz.

295
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,590
I'm standing on the roof,
and she's pointing a gun at me.

296
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,010
We're out in the cold,
and I'm panicked.

297
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,989
I'm telling her about a story
I wrote when I was younger...

298
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:30,789
and she found it funny,
thank God.

299
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,989
She laughed.

300
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:35,269
She relaxed a little.
She put the gun down.

301
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:36,669
And you know.

302
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,749
So your writing saved your life.

303
00:15:38,849 --> 00:15:41,109
It's amazing to me.

304
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:43,190
The interesting thing to me...

305
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,189
apart from the obvious
sexual guilt...

306
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:48,229
that I had when I was
a young man in the story...

307
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:50,429
is that nothing's changed.

308
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:52,230
It's years later.

309
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,389
I had a shrink then,
I have a shrink now.

310
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:55,889
I'm 6 shrinks later.

311
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,829
I'm 3 wives down the line...

312
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:00,589
and I still can't get
my love life in order.

313
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:03,140
I still love whores.

314
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,309
To me, the ideal thing
is you pay them...

315
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:09,950
and they come over
to the house...

316
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,980
and you don't have to discuss
Proust or films or...

317
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:15,699
I don't know
what's been happening to me.

318
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,869
You know,
I just have not grown up...

319
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:23,429
and I feel, you know,
it's not...

320
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:25,789
I see other guys my age.

321
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:28,349
I'm always thinking of fucking
every woman I meet.

322
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:31,709
I meet a woman, a stranger,
a woman on the bus...

323
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:33,629
I think, what would she
look like naked?

324
00:16:33,729 --> 00:16:35,549
Is it possible I can fuck her?

325
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:37,149
This is crazy.

326
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:40,349
I see guys I know
that are lawyers and doctors.

327
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:41,570
They have families and houses.

328
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,469
They're not so...

329
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,709
Does the President
of the United States...

330
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:47,060
want to fuck every woman he met.

331
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,110
Bad example.

332
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,429
But I don't know.

333
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:54,269
Take Raoul Wallenberg.

334
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:57,149
Did he want to bang every
cocktail waitress in Europe?

335
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,949
Probably not, but...

336
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:01,069
Tell me about
your honoring ceremony tomorrow.

337
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:03,109
Oh, that's bullshit.

338
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:07,069
It's ironic that the same school
that threw me out years ago...

339
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:08,669
now wants to honor me.

340
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:10,309
Why'd they throw you out?

341
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:13,349
Because I was not interested
in college.

342
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,869
I wanted to be a writer.

343
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:16,509
That's all I cared about
was writing.

344
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,670
I did not care
about the real world.

345
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,509
I cared
only about the world of fiction.

346
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:24,709
And, plus, I tried to give
the dean's wife an enema...

347
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:26,829
so they didn't take
kindly to that.

348
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:29,189
But the sad thing is...

349
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:32,589
I gotta drive upstate
to be honored...

350
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:34,309
and I have to go by myself.

351
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:35,749
I got nobody to go with.

352
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:38,229
It's, you know, I...
OK, so...

353
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:40,989
And...
You know, I can't...

354
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:43,070
What about bringing your son up
with you?

355
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,349
It's not my visiting time
with him.

356
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:47,389
And Joan
is completely inflexible.

357
00:17:47,489 --> 00:17:49,790
She won't trade dates with you?

358
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,789
I can't even
get her on the phone.

359
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:54,389
She hates me.

360
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:55,830
I don't know. Lately...

361
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:59,110
For the first time in my life,
I experienced writer's block.

362
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,349
This, to me, is unheard of.

363
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:04,709
I start these short stories,
and I can't finish them.

364
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:07,910
I can't get into my novel
at all...

365
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,700
because I took an advance.

366
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:13,189
I don't know.

367
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:17,350
I find that I'm taking
more pills and medicine and...

368
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,189
You remind me
of that short story...

369
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:21,829
you were working on
maybe two months ago...

370
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:23,099
<i>The Actor.</i>

371
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:26,249
This goddamn lens
has something wrong with it.

372
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:27,790
This one, too?
I changed lenses.

373
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,869
The focus is off.

374
00:18:29,969 --> 00:18:31,589
I don't know why.

375
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:33,509
It's out of focus.

376
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:34,989
All the lenses can't be soft.

377
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:36,469
Let's move it along.

378
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:38,149
It's getting late.
Let's move it.

379
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:40,709
I'm trying to shoot Mel,
and he's soft.

380
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:42,669
Where are you renting
these lenses?

381
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:44,059
The lenses are fine.

382
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,509
Holy shit. Mel's out of focus.

383
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:47,869
That's what I said, genius.

384
00:18:47,969 --> 00:18:50,029
I don't mean the lens.
Mel himself.

385
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,510
Let me see.

386
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,990
You're right.
Mel's out of focus.

387
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,750
What are you talking about?

388
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,869
The actor's out of focus.

389
00:18:57,969 --> 00:18:59,149
How can this be?

390
00:18:59,249 --> 00:19:00,549
Is there something wrong?

391
00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:01,790
Mel, come here.

392
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,989
I don't know
how to tell you this.

393
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:06,190
You're soft.

394
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,949
I've gained a little weight.

395
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:09,829
It's not that. You're soft.

396
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:11,909
You're out of focus.

397
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:13,190
I don't know why.

398
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,789
Is there anything we can do?

399
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:16,669
I can't adjust this.

400
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:18,550
Just look at yourself.

401
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,509
There's nothing to do.

402
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:22,450
You sure you're OK?

403
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,789
It's fuzzy.

404
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:26,029
I feel fine.

405
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:27,569
Mel's out of focus.

406
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:29,110
He's soft.

407
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,789
I don't know what to do.

408
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:32,390
It's almost 4:00 anyway.

409
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,989
Why don't we just wrap?

410
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,230
We'll wrap
and see what happens.

411
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:40,869
I want you to go home and rest.

412
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:42,939
See if you can sharpen up.

413
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,260
Grace, I'm home.

414
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,389
Hey. What's the matter?

415
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:56,349
You look strange.

416
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:57,989
I'm out of focus.

417
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:02,289
Yeah, you are.
Just a little bit.

418
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:03,429
And you look pale.

419
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:05,189
Daddy, you're all blurry.

420
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:07,269
Maybe you should lie down.

421
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:09,469
Daddy's out of focus!

422
00:20:09,569 --> 00:20:11,269
Daddy doesn't need that, OK?

423
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:13,029
You be nice.

424
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,269
What happened at work?

425
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:16,789
Daddy's out of focus!

426
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:18,070
Rueben! Stop it!

427
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:22,349
They thought it was the camera.
Then... it was me.

428
00:20:22,449 --> 00:20:24,149
They sent me home.
It's so humiliating.

429
00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:27,029
Did you eat anything strange
at lunch? Any shellfish?

430
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:30,069
This isn't an allergic reaction.
I don't know what it is.

431
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:32,389
I just need to get
a good night's sleep.

432
00:20:32,489 --> 00:20:33,669
I'll be OK.

433
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:34,869
I'm sure that's all it is.

434
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:36,189
What happened to you?

435
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:40,550
You get a good night's sleep,
and tomorrow you'll be fine.

436
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,990
<i>The following morning, however,</i>
<i>things did not improve.</i>

437
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,310
<i>In fact, the situation</i>
<i>had gotten worse.</i>

438
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,774
<i>Mel was more out of focus</i>
<i>than ever.</i>

439
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,180
I gotta get to the doctor.

440
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:54,389
I've never seen anything
like this.

441
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:57,629
Nothing's is wrong with you,
except you're out of focus.

442
00:20:57,729 --> 00:20:59,750
What's the matter?

443
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,029
It's from looking at Mel,
I'm seasick.

444
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:04,379
That's why I want everyone
to try these.

445
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,069
I don't want to wear glasses.

446
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:10,310
Wait. Let's see.

447
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,629
Put 'em on
so you can see me, son.

448
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,030
This is much better.

449
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,670
You'll be able to see me.

450
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,429
Put those on.
Daddy'll be sharper.

451
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:19,390
Don't you want to see Daddy?

452
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,509
Put those on,
and we won't get headaches.

453
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:25,670
Despite the fact that children
don't want to wear glasses...

454
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,140
they're forced to.

455
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:32,229
You expect the world to adjust
to the distortion you've become.

456
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:33,910
I don't expect anything.

457
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,949
I'm going through something...
I don't know what.

458
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:40,669
For the first time in my life,
I can't seem to write.

459
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:41,909
It's not coming.

460
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,909
And for me...

461
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:46,469
all I have in life
is my imagination.

462
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:48,629
I'm sorry. Our time is up.

463
00:21:48,729 --> 00:21:50,829
Have a good time
at the honoring ceremony.

464
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:53,029
I think it would be good
for you and your son...

465
00:21:53,129 --> 00:21:55,100
if you brought him along.

466
00:21:57,219 --> 00:21:59,229
Joan, you never
return my phone calls.

467
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:01,350
Oh, leave me alone.

468
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,229
Do you want me to call
the police?

469
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:04,829
I've got to ask you
one question.

470
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:06,770
I don't want to listen to you.

471
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,549
Tomorrow they're honoring me
at Adair, my old university.

472
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:10,789
I want to take Hilly.

473
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:12,069
He has school tomorrow.

474
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:13,989
I want to trade
one visitation day.

475
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:15,269
I have plans with Hilly.

476
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:16,549
It'll be good to see.

477
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:18,469
The kid will see
his father honored.

478
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:20,709
I don't want him to see you!

479
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:23,710
He'll have a day in the country.
Will you stop for one second?

480
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,109
A day in the country.
What is so bad?

481
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:27,509
He is nine years old.

482
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:30,869
Where does he learn phrases like
"banging beaver" and "fuck God?"

483
00:22:30,969 --> 00:22:32,229
What, from me?

484
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:33,829
What do I look like,
an imbecile?

485
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:36,190
I know what your conversations
are like with him...

486
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,670
and don't think I didn't hear
about Open School Week.

487
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,309
Beth Kramer has never been
so appalled in her entire life!

488
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:44,419
Dad, why doesn't my penis
look like yours?

489
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,229
Why doesn't your penis
look like mine?

490
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:51,300
Because your mother and I
never had you circumcised.

491
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,789
When I was your age,
every kid in my neighborhood...

492
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:56,989
you know what they used to do?
They'd name their penises.

493
00:22:57,089 --> 00:22:58,589
I'm going to name mine
Dillinger.

494
00:22:58,689 --> 00:23:00,429
Dillinger is perfect!

495
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:01,869
Dillinger is great!

496
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:03,589
Hilly, you're inspired.
You're a genius.

497
00:23:03,689 --> 00:23:06,829
Dillinger was one of the great
geniuses of his profession.

498
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:08,430
Like Willy Sutton.

499
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,629
Remember when we discussed
Freud once?

500
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:14,030
Freud said the 2 most important
things to having a good life...

501
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,910
are the work that you choose
and sex.

502
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,509
Those are the 2 things.

503
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:20,630
Women are God.

504
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,870
God's a woman?

505
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,109
I'm not saying God's a woman.

506
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:25,830
There are women.

507
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,389
We don't know if there's a God,
but there are women...

508
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:31,590
not in some imaginary heaven,
but right here on earth.

509
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:36,429
And some of them, Hilly,
shop at Victoria's Secret.

510
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:40,230
Beth Kramer has never been
so mortified in her life.

511
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,589
Beth Kramer's an aggressive,
tight-assed, busybody cunt...

512
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:46,509
and it's none of her business
how I speak to my son.

513
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:48,870
Beth Kramer is a decent parent
and a great friend.

514
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,029
Oh, Bullshit.

515
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:52,269
I'm asking you to change
one visitation day.

516
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:53,629
What is so terrible?

517
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:56,189
He is not gonna miss
a day of school.

518
00:23:56,289 --> 00:23:57,709
What if he was sick?

519
00:23:57,809 --> 00:23:59,990
He would miss school.

520
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,630
But he is not sick...

521
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,869
and he's not gonna
spend the afternoon...

522
00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:06,310
with his pill-popping,
alcoholic...

523
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,190
beaver-banging excuse
for a father.

524
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,429
Years ago,
you didn't say that about me.

525
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:12,549
You didn't think that.

526
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:14,309
You were a nice, loose,
easygoing spirit.

527
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:15,589
Put it in a book!

528
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:17,699
What am I saying?
You already did.

529
00:24:19,197 --> 00:24:21,489
<i>Epstein had married</i>
<i>his third shrink.</i>

530
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:24,309
<i>He had confessed his feelings</i>
<i>toward her several times...</i>

531
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:26,909
<i>and it seemed she had put it</i>
<i>down to transference...</i>

532
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:29,333
<i>but one day, she surprised him.</i>

533
00:24:29,489 --> 00:24:31,149
I think it best...

534
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:33,380
that we terminate
your treatment.

535
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:36,070
And then I think...

536
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,910
we should give it
a substantial period of time...

537
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,269
and then if we both feel
the same way...

538
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:45,390
I think we can begin
to see each other again...

539
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,719
socially.

540
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:52,429
<i>It was, to Epstein's thinking,</i>
<i>a match made in heaven.</i>

541
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:55,782
<i>Here, at last, was a woman</i>
<i>who understood him.</i>

542
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:59,869
You know all my secrets,
every nuance of my psychic life.

543
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:02,829
There isn't a feeling or desire
that I haven't admitted to you.

544
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:05,189
Now it's your turn
to explore me.

545
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:07,669
But all my perversions,
you accept them.

546
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:10,549
My need to be tied up,
to watch you with other women...

547
00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:12,989
to feel your spike heels
in my mouth.

548
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:15,150
No one can say
that I didn't know...

549
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,140
what I was
letting myself in for.

550
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,829
<i>The first 2 years were amazing.</i>

551
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:24,269
<i>They moved into a large</i>
<i>Westend Avenue apartment.</i>

552
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:26,390
<i>He wrote. She saw patients.</i>

553
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,559
<i>But her clearest insights</i>
<i>were into his work.</i>

554
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,269
What one comes away with...

555
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:33,989
is your total isolation,
your fear of people...

556
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:36,049
your panic over closeness...

557
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:38,869
and that's why your real life
is so chaotic...

558
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:42,310
and your writing is so much
more controlled and stable.

559
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,909
You're unable to...

560
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:45,870
<i>Yes, it all went quite well...</i>

561
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,429
<i>until Helen became pregnant</i>
<i>and gave birth.</i>

562
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:49,969
<i>From that moment on...</i>

563
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:52,789
<i>as if she had experienced</i>
<i>a divine revelation...</i>

564
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:56,149
<i>she suddenly became what</i>
<i>Epstein referred to angrily...</i>

565
00:25:56,249 --> 00:25:58,332
<i>as "Jewish with a vengeance."</i>

566
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:02,909
I rue the day I listened to you
and didn't have him circumcised.

567
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:04,390
What are you, nuts?

568
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,989
We can still do it.

569
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:07,669
No. He's too old.

570
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:09,309
What is wrong with you?

571
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:11,249
Now he's too old.

572
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:13,190
You're like
a born-again Christian...

573
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,550
except you're a Jew.

574
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,349
I see my father's face
in Hillel.

575
00:26:17,449 --> 00:26:18,950
Hilliard.

576
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,669
His name is Hilliard.

577
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:22,309
We didn't name him Hillel.

578
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:24,349
We didn't name him
after some rabbi.

579
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:25,589
It's Hilliard Epstein.

580
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:27,430
No, I'm sick
of your smug cynicism.

581
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,029
There's value in tradition.

582
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,689
I never thought
it would mean anything...

583
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,629
but now that I'm a mother,
it does.

584
00:26:32,729 --> 00:26:36,309
I see not only meaning
in Judaism, but true beauty.

585
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:37,990
Helen, you're a scientist.

586
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,641
Einstein was a scientist...

587
00:26:39,768 --> 00:26:42,194
and a he was a Jew,
and he was religious.

588
00:26:42,628 --> 00:26:46,309
<i>Helen had taken on</i>
<i>the obligation of daily prayers.</i>

589
00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:47,590
<i>Jews, of course...</i>

590
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,989
<i>fearing a wrathful</i>
<i>and vengeful God...</i>

591
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:52,539
<i>give praise and thanks</i>
<i>for everything.</i>

592
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:55,887
Baruch atah adonai elohenu melech
ha-olam...

593
00:26:56,169 --> 00:26:57,727
borei pree hagofen.

594
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,804
Hamotzi lechem...

595
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,568
min ha-oretz.

596
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,888
Vitzi-vonu I'hadlik nair
shel shabat.

597
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,605
Boreh pree ha... blowjob.

598
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,549
<i>Then one day,</i>
<i>the inevitable happened.</i>

599
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:15,469
<i>A patient of Helen's,</i>
<i>an Israeli...</i>

600
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:17,669
<i>who had come to her</i>
<i>in a depressed state...</i>

601
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,749
<i>over his wife having left him...</i>

602
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:21,740
<i>captured Helen's heart.</i>

603
00:27:21,894 --> 00:27:23,909
I think we should
terminate your treatment...

604
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:27,309
and give it a substantial
period of time...

605
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:29,110
and then if we both
still feel the same way...

606
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:32,739
then I think we could start
to see each other socially.

607
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:41,269
Richard.

608
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:42,870
...lost in thought.

609
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,869
I was thinking about a book
I wrote.

610
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:48,069
- I'm a mess.
- What's the matter?

611
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:49,949
I'm on my way to the doctor's.

612
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:51,869
I'm having severe pains
in my chest.

613
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:53,509
That's nothing.

614
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:56,909
That's indigestion, gallbladder,
ulcer, or acid reflux.

615
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,149
I've got a family history.

616
00:27:58,249 --> 00:27:59,470
My father
died of a heart attack...

617
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,330
my mother dropped dead
of a massive coronary...

618
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,659
and both my brothers were dead
before 50 from heart failure.

619
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:07,469
I don't know
why you're wasting time.

620
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:08,909
You should get an ambulance.

621
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:11,589
- Are you busy?
- I was gonna see my editor.

622
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,750
I hate going
for these tests alone.

623
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:17,269
My mother died
giving birth to me...

624
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:19,669
for which my father
never forgave me.

625
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:23,509
Funny. I wish before he died
I had forgiven him.

626
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:27,149
We're morbid, 'cause you think
you're dying, but you're not.

627
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,510
Today, they got lasers,
all kinds of things.

628
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,569
You and science, right?

629
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:33,549
There's nothing wrong
with science.

630
00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:35,569
Between air conditioning
and the pope...

631
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:37,029
I'll take air conditioning.

632
00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:38,749
I'm scared. Really scared.

633
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:41,549
Can we change the subject?

634
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:43,059
I have writer's block.

635
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,069
For the first time in my life...

636
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:48,349
I can't come up
with a meaningful idea...

637
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:49,689
something that holds
my interest.

638
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:52,469
Since Fay left you,
you've been having trouble.

639
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:54,789
I'm seeing Fay later.
I'm having a drink with Fay.

640
00:28:54,889 --> 00:28:56,149
That's very good.

641
00:28:56,249 --> 00:28:58,029
She's good for you.

642
00:28:58,129 --> 00:28:59,749
She's a lot better...

643
00:28:59,849 --> 00:29:02,669
than a lot of those
other crazies that you...

644
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:04,230
Ow. My God, my arm.

645
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,659
I'm telling you, it's nothing.

646
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,069
I'm not scared.

647
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:12,710
You're in great shape.

648
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,269
You have a little bursitis
in your arm, but...

649
00:29:15,369 --> 00:29:16,550
Oh, that's fantastic.

650
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,470
What do I always say?

651
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,330
The most beautiful words
in the English language...

652
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,590
are not "I love you",
but "it's benign."

653
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,470
We could do more tests,
but I don't think so.

654
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,869
- This is fantastic.
- Your heart's in great shape.

655
00:29:27,969 --> 00:29:29,190
While I'm here...

656
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,690
I hurt my back a few weeks ago,
opening a subzero refrigerator.

657
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,770
Let me schedule you.

658
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,869
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

659
00:29:34,969 --> 00:29:35,989
I don't have time.

660
00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:37,509
What are you doing tomorrow?

661
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,190
I'm busy. Why?

662
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:42,029
I'm going to my old university.
They're honoring me.

663
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:44,029
I'm looking for company
to come with me.

664
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:48,709
I don't think I can get out
of this thing, but that's great.

665
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:50,500
Congratulations.

666
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,389
So you look great.

667
00:30:08,489 --> 00:30:10,829
Thank you.
You look a little tired.

668
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:14,349
'Cause I'm struggling
with this book.

669
00:30:14,449 --> 00:30:17,309
Naturally,
I spent the advance already.

670
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:19,989
I'm having a tough time.

671
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:23,149
The reason that I wanted
to have this drink was...

672
00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:27,269
Can I get a red wine,
exact same thing that she has?

673
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:29,709
I wanted to be the first
to tell you...

674
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:31,389
that I'm getting married.

675
00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:33,230
Oh, don't say that.

676
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,909
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

677
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:38,590
Because I love you.

678
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,269
How can you get married?

679
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:42,550
Who? is it Larry?

680
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,619
Yes, it's Larry.

681
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:46,670
I knew that.
I don't fucking believe this.

682
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,340
This guy's allegedly
a friend of mine.

683
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,509
He's the devil.

684
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:52,949
I should never
have introduced you.

685
00:30:53,049 --> 00:30:55,419
When Larry's around,
I smell burning sulfur.

686
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,579
Can we have your blessing?
Can I have it?

687
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,030
You don't have my blessing.

688
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,989
I don't want you to get married.

689
00:31:04,089 --> 00:31:05,859
I don't want you to.

690
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,195
I should go.

691
00:31:07,295 --> 00:31:08,469
I was your pupil.

692
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:11,230
It was Henry Higgins
and Eliza Doolittle.

693
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,589
That's what it was,
and that's what you loved.

694
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:16,669
But it didn't work that way.
What do you want me to say?

695
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:18,510
Why did you
fall in love with me?

696
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,150
You gave me those lectures
on love in the Western world.

697
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,310
I didn't think I could.
I thought I was too damaged.

698
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,349
But it's not...

699
00:31:28,449 --> 00:31:29,669
I woke up one morning...

700
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:32,029
and I looked at you
over breakfast...

701
00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:36,629
and I thought to myself,
"God, this is what they mean."

702
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:38,790
"This is what
they're talking about."

703
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,610
Those warnings about how
I wasn't supposed...

704
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,189
to fall in love with you.

705
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:44,069
But then I fell in love
with you.

706
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,229
...another jerk fan.

707
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:49,350
That I would fuck you
and move on to the next fan.

708
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,270
But it didn't happen that way.

709
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:55,309
You were a fan and a follower...

710
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:59,149
and then a pupil,
and then you were a roommate.

711
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:01,509
And before I knew it...

712
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:04,660
you were the one who had control
of the channel changer.

713
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,990
I loved you.

714
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,989
I was in awe of you.

715
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:17,470
But I wasn't in love with you.

716
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,309
...to my old university.

717
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:21,669
They're honoring me,
if you can believe that.

718
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:23,909
Give me a chance
to talk you out of it.

719
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:25,509
Spend one day with me.

720
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:27,869
I'm getting married tomorrow.

721
00:32:27,969 --> 00:32:30,189
Tomorrow you're getting married?

722
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:31,589
The day I'm honored...

723
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:33,169
I can't fucking believe this.

724
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:34,489
You're getting married tomorrow?

725
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:37,269
Yes. It's been planned
for months.

726
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:38,660
Don't do it!

727
00:32:45,187 --> 00:32:47,069
<i>While Goldberg was asleep</i>
<i>one night...</i>

728
00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:49,229
<i>the devil</i>
<i>entered his apartment...</i>

729
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:51,189
<i>and abducted</i>
<i>his beautiful blond love...</i>

730
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:53,331
<i>and carried her off to hell.</i>

731
00:32:53,688 --> 00:32:54,949
<i>The following morning...</i>

732
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:58,539
<i>Goldberg noticed the odd smell</i>
<i>of burning sulfur.</i>

733
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,709
Harry Block?

734
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:06,949
You're Cookie?

735
00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:08,349
Cookie Williams.

736
00:33:08,449 --> 00:33:10,089
You wanted me here at 10:00?

737
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:11,300
Yeah. Jesus.

738
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,779
Shall we get to it?

739
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,829
You don't want to talk
a little first?

740
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:23,780
Talk? Why?

741
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,349
Really? Most guys don't like
to just jump right into bed...

742
00:33:27,449 --> 00:33:28,629
without a little talking.

743
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:30,290
They think
it's too businesslike.

744
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,509
Oh, not me.

745
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,869
...tie me up.

746
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,189
Whatever you want.

747
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:36,269
Let's get the monetary part
out of the way.

748
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:37,429
Then we can relax.

749
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:38,670
Absolutely. You get 200?

750
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,069
That's right.

751
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:42,189
You want me to tie you up?

752
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:46,189
Tie me up, hit me a little bit,
and give me a blow job.

753
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:48,270
A blow job, then hit you.

754
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:52,189
No. Hit me, then the blow job.
I want to get the order right.

755
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:53,389
Otherwise, it's no fun.

756
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,589
Tie me up, hit me, blow job.

757
00:33:55,689 --> 00:33:57,549
What do you want me
to tie you with?

758
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:00,789
Well, truth is, I thought
you were gonna wear stockings.

759
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:02,950
Cookie,
you're a definite artist.

760
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,349
They should put your lips
in the Smithsonian.

761
00:34:05,449 --> 00:34:07,109
It took you a long time.

762
00:34:07,209 --> 00:34:08,829
I didn't think you'd make it.

763
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,570
I was having a problem focusing.

764
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,429
Finally,
I got the right fantasy.

765
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:16,829
I thought of a woman
I saw on Sixth Avenue today...

766
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,430
and I coupled her
with Svetlana Stalin.

767
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,269
It's the daughter
of the dictator.

768
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:22,589
It worked for me.

769
00:34:22,689 --> 00:34:24,059
What do you take medicine for?

770
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,830
Me? Depression.

771
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,829
What are you depressed about?

772
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:30,709
Depressed.
Don't you ever get depressed?

773
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:33,629
Doesn't your work
ever get you down?

774
00:34:33,729 --> 00:34:35,739
It's OK. Beats the hell
out of waitressing.

775
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:40,909
Every hooker I ever speak to
tells me it beats waitressing.

776
00:34:41,009 --> 00:34:43,749
Waitressing's got to be
the worst job in the world.

777
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:44,949
It's unbelievable.

778
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,229
What are you sad about?

779
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:50,229
I'm spiritually bankrupt.
I'm empty.

780
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:51,669
What do you mean?

781
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:53,189
I'm frightened.

782
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:56,149
I got no soul.
You know what I mean?

783
00:34:56,249 --> 00:34:57,509
Let me put it this way.

784
00:34:57,609 --> 00:34:58,629
When I was younger...

785
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,850
it was less scary
waiting for Lefty...

786
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,499
than it is waiting for Godot.

787
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:04,419
Aw, you lost me.

788
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,149
You know that the universe
is coming apart?

789
00:35:08,249 --> 00:35:11,069
You know what a black hole is?

790
00:35:11,169 --> 00:35:13,019
Yeah.
That's how I make my living.

791
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,250
You know, I gotta tell you,
Cookie....

792
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,269
a great writer
named Sophocles...

793
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:20,310
said that it was probably
best not to be born at all.

794
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,140
Honey,
it's a little too late for that.

795
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,430
I fought it.

796
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,820
I didn't want out.
They had to come and get me.

797
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,660
You want another blow job?

798
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,949
How come?

799
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:33,789
It's on the house.
No charge.

800
00:35:33,889 --> 00:35:36,580
'Cause them pills you taking
sure ain't working.

801
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,429
I'm just in a peculiar mood
tonight...

802
00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:42,349
'cause I had
some bad news today.

803
00:35:42,449 --> 00:35:45,019
Let me ask you a question.
What are you doing tomorrow?

804
00:35:45,779 --> 00:35:46,779
Hustlin'.

805
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,469
Why don't you come with me?

806
00:35:49,569 --> 00:35:50,709
Where?

807
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:54,070
I'm going up to my old school
'cause they're gonna honor me.

808
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,900
I got nobody to share it with.

809
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:58,389
I'm serious. Come with me.

810
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,709
I'll give you 500 bucks
for the day.

811
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:02,929
Sleep here tonight,
come up with me tomorrow.

812
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:04,529
How come you got all this money?

813
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,550
I always keep
hooker money around...

814
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,629
'cause I once paid
by check years ago...

815
00:36:08,729 --> 00:36:10,140
and the IRS killed me.

816
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:26,309
Fay, when you get this message,
if it's not too late...

817
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:28,750
I don't want you
to get married...

818
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:32,989
because I love you,
and I want to marry you.

819
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:34,180
You...

820
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,429
I was looking at my last book...

821
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,349
the part where we met...

822
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:44,390
and I tried to exaggerate it
to make it funny...

823
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:47,379
but it was actually
very romantic.

824
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:51,110
She can't hear.

825
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,030
I'm in town to see Les Mis.

826
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,309
I have a free hour.

827
00:36:54,409 --> 00:36:56,989
I don't know if I can.

828
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,909
I got our usual place
at the Wyndham.

829
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:00,529
It's been almost two weeks.

830
00:37:00,629 --> 00:37:03,389
We'll have to make it fast.

831
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:05,420
I can't make it believable
for so long.

832
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,509
You'll be back in an hour.

833
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:14,579
I have to be done
by then anyway.

834
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:19,090
Think I'll take a walk.

835
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,709
Now?

836
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:25,029
'Cause I thought
that I would just...

837
00:37:25,129 --> 00:37:27,900
just to get some fresh air.

838
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,389
Excuse me.

839
00:37:59,489 --> 00:38:01,420
Are you Harry Block?

840
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,789
Your writing has been
so meaningful to me.

841
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:07,670
Thank you very much.

842
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,629
Can't believe
I'm in the elevator with you.

843
00:38:09,729 --> 00:38:11,709
It's no big deal.

844
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:13,550
Are you staying here?

845
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,340
I'm meeting someone.

846
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,789
Oh, my God.

847
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:28,510
What is this?

848
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,669
It's stuck again.

849
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:32,509
If this was one of my stories...

850
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:34,909
this elevator would get
stuck between floors...

851
00:38:35,009 --> 00:38:38,020
and the two of us would start
a major affair and fall in love.

852
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:51,499
Promise me
you won't fall in love with me.

853
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,349
Definitely not.
Not a good idea.

854
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:56,589
Why?

855
00:38:56,689 --> 00:39:01,109
Because I'm too screwed up.

856
00:39:01,209 --> 00:39:05,379
I have too many quirks.

857
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:09,949
I have trouble being faithful.

858
00:39:10,049 --> 00:39:13,809
I have too many phobias
and craziness.

859
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:17,029
But I fell in love with you
before I met you...

860
00:39:17,129 --> 00:39:19,110
when I read you.

861
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,190
But you fell in love
with my work.

862
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,140
That's a different thing.

863
00:39:24,019 --> 00:39:27,869
I love your work,
your imagination.

864
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:31,570
But this is not a book.

865
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,169
You know what I mean?

866
00:39:33,269 --> 00:39:36,539
We're not characters
in a fictional thing.

867
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:39,430
So don't fall in love.

868
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,709
Kiss me.

869
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:43,869
Promise you won't
fall in love with me.

870
00:39:43,969 --> 00:39:45,060
I promise.

871
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,909
The subway took forever.
I'm sorry.

872
00:40:07,009 --> 00:40:09,789
You said you weren't coming.

873
00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:11,309
We said 10:00.

874
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,229
I'm sure that's what we said.

875
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:15,709
I called you last night.

876
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:16,949
When did you call me?

877
00:40:17,049 --> 00:40:18,829
I called you at 9:30 last night.

878
00:40:18,929 --> 00:40:20,949
You were writing...

879
00:40:21,049 --> 00:40:22,350
We spoke on the phone?

880
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,109
Of course.

881
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:26,029
My mind has been playing tricks.

882
00:40:26,129 --> 00:40:27,749
This is Cookie.
This is Richard.

883
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:29,109
How are you?

884
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:30,929
What's so special
about this honor?

885
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:33,870
The man is being honored
by the school that expelled him.

886
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:36,350
If only Hilly could see me...
he'd be so proud.

887
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,970
I know, and it's sad...

888
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,660
but short of kidnapping,
he ain't coming.

889
00:40:44,139 --> 00:40:46,630
- This is ridiculous.
- Don't worry.

890
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,469
You're going to get in trouble.

891
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:49,980
Come on, boys.

892
00:40:51,939 --> 00:40:53,549
Dad? What is it?

893
00:40:53,649 --> 00:40:55,629
We're not going to school today.

894
00:40:55,729 --> 00:40:57,549
What are you doing? Stop it!

895
00:40:57,649 --> 00:40:58,749
It's an emergency.

896
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:00,589
What are you doing? Come on.

897
00:41:00,689 --> 00:41:02,749
You! Stop it!

898
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:04,190
You can't do this!

899
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,659
Get out of the car!

900
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:09,349
Somebody stop this man!

901
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:10,549
He's a deviant!

902
00:41:10,649 --> 00:41:13,949
Somebody stop him!
Somebody call the police!

903
00:41:14,049 --> 00:41:15,430
When the red, red robin...

904
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:17,330
comes bob, bob, bobbin' along.

905
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,309
- Go faster.

906
00:41:19,409 --> 00:41:23,229
There'll be no more sobbin'
when he starts throbbin' his...

907
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:24,470
old sweet song.

908
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:27,389
Wake up, wake up,
you sleepyhead.

909
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:29,949
Get up, get up, get out of bed.

910
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:32,549
Cheer up, cheer up,
the sun is red.

911
00:41:32,649 --> 00:41:35,220
Live, love, laugh, and be happy.

912
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:41,269
It's fabulous here.

913
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:42,789
It's beautiful. I love it.

914
00:41:42,889 --> 00:41:44,269
A Ferris wheel.

915
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:45,549
Look at the swings.

916
00:41:45,649 --> 00:41:46,979
Want to go?

917
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,019
Very good.

918
00:41:59,459 --> 00:42:01,099
High-five.

919
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,269
I am going to smoke this joint.
Want some?

920
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:10,549
I can't stand that stuff.

921
00:42:10,649 --> 00:42:12,630
See that place there?

922
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,909
That "Red Apple" Rest?

923
00:42:15,009 --> 00:42:18,790
Years ago,
my then-wife Jane and I...

924
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,109
were coming from Connecticut...
her sister's house...

925
00:42:21,209 --> 00:42:23,029
and we had this awful fight.

926
00:42:23,129 --> 00:42:24,229
She was having her period.

927
00:42:24,329 --> 00:42:26,350
We stopped there
to get water for her Midol.

928
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,029
I don't want a child.

929
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,629
Don't bring it up, especially
in front of my parents.

930
00:42:30,729 --> 00:42:32,189
I don't understand you.

931
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:33,949
We've discussed it.

932
00:42:34,049 --> 00:42:36,149
- Don't I get a vote?
- You have a child.

933
00:42:36,249 --> 00:42:37,629
Who I never get to see.

934
00:42:37,729 --> 00:42:38,869
That's not my fault.

935
00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:40,429
I like being a father.

936
00:42:40,529 --> 00:42:42,189
I chose a different life
than Lucy.

937
00:42:42,289 --> 00:42:43,409
You knew that.

938
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:44,669
You're dedicated to work.

939
00:42:44,769 --> 00:42:46,110
That means we can't
have children.

940
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:48,050
Since when are you a family man?

941
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,949
Don't think I don't see you
staring at Lucy.

942
00:42:51,049 --> 00:42:52,209
What?

943
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:53,630
Don't play ignorant.

944
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,509
You watch her walk, sit.

945
00:42:55,609 --> 00:42:58,469
You can't keep your eyes
off her toes.

946
00:42:58,569 --> 00:42:59,829
Are you nuts?

947
00:42:59,929 --> 00:43:01,190
What are you suggesting?

948
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,909
I wouldn't put it past you...

949
00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:05,349
if you weren't dying
to have a thing with her.

950
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:08,069
She's a neurotic,
suburban hausfrau.

951
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:10,589
I have no interest in her.

952
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:13,549
Your level of denial is intense.

953
00:43:13,649 --> 00:43:16,659
You're suffering from
a premenstrual nuclear meltdown.

954
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,979
You want a hit?

955
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:23,020
That smoke is killing me.

956
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:25,909
I'm going to the bathroom.

957
00:43:26,009 --> 00:43:27,420
I'll catch you later.

958
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,949
Cold fish, your third ex-wife.

959
00:43:43,049 --> 00:43:45,309
She never would have made
a good mother.

960
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:47,189
Who are you?

961
00:43:47,289 --> 00:43:48,700
It's me...Ken.

962
00:43:51,779 --> 00:43:52,849
Look at this guy.

963
00:43:52,949 --> 00:43:55,749
You created me.
Now you don't recognize me?

964
00:43:55,849 --> 00:43:58,269
I'm a little high
because of her smoke.

965
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,349
How'd you hook up with Jane?

966
00:44:00,449 --> 00:44:01,550
Jane was fine.

967
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:04,349
Jane was having her period,
so she was irritable.

968
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:06,149
It wasn't just her period.

969
00:44:06,249 --> 00:44:08,849
She was a cold, selfish woman.

970
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:10,069
She's so self-involved...

971
00:44:10,169 --> 00:44:13,109
she doesn't realize
her sister hates her.

972
00:44:13,209 --> 00:44:15,729
How do you know so much?

973
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:18,149
I'm just you, thinly disguised.

974
00:44:18,249 --> 00:44:21,379
You gave me more maturity
and a different name.

975
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,349
What are you saying?
That I know this?

976
00:44:24,449 --> 00:44:26,350
Of course you do.
That's why you picked her...

977
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:27,870
so it wouldn't work...

978
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:29,949
so you'd never have
to give up sport-fucking...

979
00:44:30,049 --> 00:44:32,469
and chronic dissatisfaction
and grow up.

980
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:36,210
I'm not going to get lectured
by my own creation.

981
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,189
You can't fool me.

982
00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:39,889
I'm not like your shrink.

983
00:44:39,989 --> 00:44:42,429
He only knows what you tell him.
I know the truth.

984
00:44:42,529 --> 00:44:45,539
Her sister Lucy...
another head case.

985
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,669
You sure can pick 'em.

986
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,709
Even she was better than Jane...

987
00:44:50,809 --> 00:44:52,379
more maternal,
and she loved you.

988
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,330
You weren't there
the day your bomb dropped...

989
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,700
but take a look.

990
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,389
He left me.

991
00:45:01,489 --> 00:45:03,869
Our marriage is finished.

992
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:06,449
I'm so sorry.

993
00:45:06,549 --> 00:45:07,709
Are you shocked?

994
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:09,869
Yes and no.

995
00:45:09,969 --> 00:45:12,829
Things have not been good
for some time.

996
00:45:12,929 --> 00:45:14,339
I knew he played around.

997
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,869
You never mentioned that.

998
00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:20,830
I don't like to discuss
my private life.

999
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:22,829
I suspected Lynn, his editor.

1000
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:27,989
Then I thought it might be
Allison Davis, our friend.

1001
00:45:28,089 --> 00:45:29,940
I even thought he might
have a crush on you.

1002
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,470
Me?

1003
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:33,789
You're very beautiful.

1004
00:45:33,889 --> 00:45:35,869
We've spent
a lot of time together.

1005
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:38,669
You two get along well.

1006
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,810
Obviously, I knew you never
would in a million years...

1007
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:45,459
but I imagined
he longed for you.

1008
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,540
I think I even heard him
mention your name in his sleep.

1009
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,300
My goodness.

1010
00:45:56,459 --> 00:45:58,020
That's absurd.

1011
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:00,739
Really.

1012
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,820
You're all red.

1013
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,900
Are you OK?

1014
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,619
Since we're talking openly...

1015
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:16,739
I have a confession.

1016
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:26,029
Life takes strange twists
and turns.

1017
00:46:26,129 --> 00:46:27,269
It overwhelms us.

1018
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:29,309
We're not responsible
for our feelings.

1019
00:46:29,409 --> 00:46:31,149
Everybody's feelings
are irrational.

1020
00:46:31,249 --> 00:46:34,669
But to hear from your husband
that he found another woman...

1021
00:46:34,769 --> 00:46:37,029
He said that?

1022
00:46:37,129 --> 00:46:39,980
He said his future
is all mapped out.

1023
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:49,069
I'm going to be frank with you.
Just try and hang on...

1024
00:46:49,169 --> 00:46:50,829
I'm being replaced.

1025
00:46:50,929 --> 00:46:53,010
But it doesn't have to be
a nightmare...

1026
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,510
if we're all
just mature about it.

1027
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:56,819
Replaced by a 25-year-old.

1028
00:46:58,019 --> 00:46:59,829
Excuse me?

1029
00:46:59,929 --> 00:47:01,829
A 25-year-old...
a wannabe writer.

1030
00:47:01,929 --> 00:47:04,619
Fay Sexton is her sexy name.

1031
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:09,100
What's the matter?
Now you're white.

1032
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,020
Have you eaten anything today?

1033
00:47:17,779 --> 00:47:18,829
Have a drink.

1034
00:47:18,929 --> 00:47:20,629
Finish that.

1035
00:47:20,729 --> 00:47:22,869
Hard to believe him
when he's a liar.

1036
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:24,140
I'm weak.

1037
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:28,869
What's wrong?

1038
00:47:28,969 --> 00:47:31,149
You'd think he dumped you.

1039
00:47:31,249 --> 00:47:34,789
I know you feel bad for me,
but I can handle it.

1040
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:37,549
- Air!
- I'm in shock today, but...

1041
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:39,409
I want to speak to Fay.

1042
00:47:39,509 --> 00:47:42,469
It's Harry Block.
I've been trying to reach her.

1043
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:44,389
This is an emergency.

1044
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:45,989
I've got to talk...

1045
00:47:46,089 --> 00:47:47,949
Tell her to call me back.

1046
00:47:48,049 --> 00:47:49,309
It's the car number.

1047
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:50,549
The car.

1048
00:47:50,649 --> 00:47:52,549
Give up.
She's in love with someone else.

1049
00:47:52,649 --> 00:47:54,389
This guy is too old for her.

1050
00:47:54,489 --> 00:47:55,670
He's younger than you.

1051
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,109
I'm much too old for her.
It's ridiculous.

1052
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,750
Because of my immaturity, I have
a boyish quality that works.

1053
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:02,469
Is it much longer?

1054
00:48:02,569 --> 00:48:03,949
We were just at the fair.

1055
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:05,189
You walked, ate.

1056
00:48:05,289 --> 00:48:06,610
How much longer is it?

1057
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,189
It won't be long.

1058
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:11,710
My sister lives
10 minutes from here.

1059
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:13,490
We'll surprise her.
It'll be fun.

1060
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:14,829
You can eat, walk around...

1061
00:48:14,929 --> 00:48:16,209
She's your half-sister.

1062
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:18,469
But it'll still be 10 minutes...

1063
00:48:18,569 --> 00:48:21,500
not five, just because
she's a half-sister.

1064
00:48:25,659 --> 00:48:27,250
It's wonderful.

1065
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:28,529
It is so funny.

1066
00:48:28,629 --> 00:48:30,989
- Do you think so?
- And it's sad.

1067
00:48:31,089 --> 00:48:32,389
I really loved it.

1068
00:48:32,489 --> 00:48:34,789
You're so great, so kind.

1069
00:48:34,889 --> 00:48:38,179
You have such a sweet,
kind instinct.

1070
00:48:39,139 --> 00:48:40,869
Don't do that.

1071
00:48:40,969 --> 00:48:44,910
I count on you to be critical,
to be tough.

1072
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:46,309
You're too easy on me.

1073
00:48:46,409 --> 00:48:49,010
What was wrong with the story?

1074
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:52,549
It had no energy.

1075
00:48:52,649 --> 00:48:53,909
I became discouraged with it.

1076
00:48:54,009 --> 00:48:56,189
It doesn't release any power.

1077
00:48:56,289 --> 00:48:57,469
It came to nothing.

1078
00:48:57,569 --> 00:48:59,730
I thought it was touching.

1079
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:03,430
You knew when the boy grew up
he would never love.

1080
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:04,629
It was beautiful.

1081
00:49:04,729 --> 00:49:08,309
Your problem is you love
too easily, too much.

1082
00:49:08,409 --> 00:49:12,589
I think you're beautiful
and great and too kind to me...

1083
00:49:12,689 --> 00:49:14,180
and lovely.

1084
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,430
But you're not in love with me.

1085
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:21,149
I told you not to fall in love
with me, and I meant that.

1086
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,900
I still have not been able
to figure out why.

1087
00:49:24,939 --> 00:49:28,309
Because I'm the boy
in that story.

1088
00:49:28,409 --> 00:49:29,969
I can't love.

1089
00:49:30,069 --> 00:49:32,389
I don't want you
to get into anything.

1090
00:49:32,489 --> 00:49:33,859
You love Hilly.

1091
00:49:34,659 --> 00:49:35,939
What?

1092
00:49:40,459 --> 00:49:42,770
Because Hilly's my son.

1093
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:45,789
It's easy to love a little kid.

1094
00:49:45,889 --> 00:49:47,540
You love music.

1095
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,949
You love baseball.

1096
00:49:50,049 --> 00:49:51,749
Baseball's also easy,
because it has rules.

1097
00:49:51,849 --> 00:49:53,549
It has foul lines.

1098
00:49:53,649 --> 00:49:56,099
Women are complicated.

1099
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,390
Happy birthday.

1100
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:00,750
You're kidding.

1101
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:02,180
Open it up.

1102
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,449
You didn't have to get anything.

1103
00:50:06,549 --> 00:50:08,299
It's probably another sweater.

1104
00:50:10,059 --> 00:50:13,189
A baseball
signed by the 1951 Giants.

1105
00:50:13,289 --> 00:50:16,270
That's so great.
The '51 Giants were...

1106
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:17,549
Bobby Thompson.

1107
00:50:17,649 --> 00:50:21,070
The one genuine miracle
of my lifetime.

1108
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:22,509
When he hit that home run...

1109
00:50:22,609 --> 00:50:25,739
that was the only hint
that there may be a God.

1110
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,449
What made you think of that?

1111
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:31,489
It was easy.

1112
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:32,979
You're the greatest.

1113
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:38,669
It's your birthday today,
so you get any wish you want.

1114
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,380
Anything at all that would
make your day special.

1115
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:44,309
You are the greatest.

1116
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:45,669
I don't deserve you.

1117
00:50:45,769 --> 00:50:47,740
You're too...

1118
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:57,355
We were driving.

1119
00:50:57,455 --> 00:50:59,669
We thought we'd stop in
to see you.

1120
00:50:59,769 --> 00:51:02,149
This is Richard and Cookie.

1121
00:51:02,249 --> 00:51:04,469
I'm your Aunt Doris.

1122
00:51:04,569 --> 00:51:05,899
Remember your Uncle Burt?

1123
00:51:09,219 --> 00:51:12,370
Would you like a cookie
or something like that?

1124
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,469
Come in the kitchen here.

1125
00:51:14,569 --> 00:51:17,109
I got to go to the bathroom.
Where's the john?

1126
00:51:17,209 --> 00:51:19,389
You just go right through there.

1127
00:51:19,489 --> 00:51:20,870
Over there?

1128
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:22,739
I thought we'd drop in.

1129
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:28,670
You're the last person
I ever expected to see.

1130
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:30,109
Don't say that, Doris.

1131
00:51:30,209 --> 00:51:31,509
What's with Cookie?

1132
00:51:31,609 --> 00:51:32,869
Cookie's the nanny.

1133
00:51:32,969 --> 00:51:35,709
Where did you get her from,
an agency or a massage parlor?

1134
00:51:35,809 --> 00:51:38,349
She's sweet.
What are you picking on...

1135
00:51:38,449 --> 00:51:41,669
Still with the sexpots,
the tramps, the vilda chayes.

1136
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:43,090
She's got a Ph.D.

1137
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:45,010
I don't know how she did
on her written...

1138
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:47,309
but I'm sure she got an A-plus
on her oral.

1139
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:48,710
Give me a break.

1140
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:49,950
I'm driving upstate.

1141
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:52,550
I take the time to say hello.

1142
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,549
Can you believe
they're honoring me at Adair?

1143
00:51:54,649 --> 00:51:55,830
I can't believe it.

1144
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:59,349
Not that I care, but it's great
for Hilly to see me.

1145
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,030
The last time I saw him,
he was six years old.

1146
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:04,589
You don't exactly contact me,
either.

1147
00:52:04,689 --> 00:52:06,930
I know what you think of me.

1148
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,190
Don't start in.

1149
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:11,029
Am I wrong?
It's all over your book...

1150
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:13,509
"Jewish," "too Jewish,"
"professionally Jewish."

1151
00:52:13,609 --> 00:52:15,789
You attributed it all
to your ex-wife Joan...

1152
00:52:15,889 --> 00:52:17,509
but you gave her
the details of my life...

1153
00:52:17,609 --> 00:52:20,189
because you wanted to depict her
with contempt.

1154
00:52:20,289 --> 00:52:21,789
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1155
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,469
You don't know?

1156
00:52:23,569 --> 00:52:25,589
You made a picture of your ex
as a horror.

1157
00:52:25,689 --> 00:52:28,229
In order to make that picture
unsympathetic...

1158
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:29,710
you used some of her...

1159
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,629
but mostly, you caricatured
my religious dedication.

1160
00:52:33,729 --> 00:52:36,990
Because it enraged you
that I returned to my roots.

1161
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:39,870
What roots? You were
a wonderful, sweet kid.

1162
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:42,589
You got me through my childhood.

1163
00:52:42,689 --> 00:52:45,429
Then you go away
to Fort Lauderdale...

1164
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:48,189
and you meet this fanatic...
this zealot.

1165
00:52:48,289 --> 00:52:51,829
He fills you
full of superstition.

1166
00:52:51,929 --> 00:52:53,310
It's tradition.

1167
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:55,309
Tradition is the illusion
of permanence.

1168
00:52:55,409 --> 00:52:56,709
You have no values.

1169
00:52:56,809 --> 00:52:58,790
Your whole life,
it's nihilism, cynicism...

1170
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:01,229
sarcasm, and orgasm.

1171
00:53:01,329 --> 00:53:03,780
In France, I could run
on that slogan and win.

1172
00:53:05,259 --> 00:53:07,410
I'm a Jew. I was born a Jew.

1173
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:08,950
Do you hate me because of that?

1174
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:12,429
If our parents converted
to Catholicism...

1175
00:53:12,529 --> 00:53:15,749
a month before you were born,
we'd be Catholics.

1176
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:18,309
They're clubs.
They're exclusionary.

1177
00:53:18,409 --> 00:53:21,109
They foster
the concept of the other...

1178
00:53:21,209 --> 00:53:23,730
so you know clearly
who you should hate.

1179
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:25,309
That's enough.

1180
00:53:25,409 --> 00:53:27,750
If a Jew gets massacred...

1181
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:30,789
does that bother you more
than if a gentile gets hurt...

1182
00:53:30,889 --> 00:53:33,309
or a black or a Bosnian?

1183
00:53:33,409 --> 00:53:34,549
It does.

1184
00:53:34,649 --> 00:53:36,269
I can't help it.
It's my people.

1185
00:53:36,369 --> 00:53:38,030
They're all your people.

1186
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:39,909
Burt is right about you.

1187
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:41,789
You're a self-hating Jew.

1188
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:44,429
I may hate myself,
but not because I'm Jewish.

1189
00:53:44,529 --> 00:53:46,110
He says he's not
a self-hating Jew...

1190
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:49,099
and look how he talks about them
in his stories.

1191
00:53:50,659 --> 00:53:53,589
Max and Dolly Pincus
were married for 30 years.

1192
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:54,910
They raised two children...

1193
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:57,189
and there was never a family
wedding or bar mitzvah...

1194
00:53:57,289 --> 00:53:59,469
where they were not
generous participants.

1195
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:00,779
Max, how are you?

1196
00:54:01,859 --> 00:54:03,349
Yossel, mazel tov.

1197
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:04,630
For Donald.

1198
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:05,900
Thank you.

1199
00:54:10,659 --> 00:54:14,110
Dolly, you got a private minute?

1200
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:15,350
Sure.

1201
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,659
We are leaving in a few minutes.

1202
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,790
I don't know
if I should tell you.

1203
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:23,109
Tell me what?

1204
00:54:23,209 --> 00:54:25,750
Tell me, and I will tell you
if you should tell me.

1205
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:27,029
My heart is heavy.

1206
00:54:27,129 --> 00:54:28,429
What happened?

1207
00:54:28,529 --> 00:54:31,149
Nothing terrible happened
to your husband Phil, did it?

1208
00:54:31,249 --> 00:54:32,780
He has been dead
for so many years.

1209
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,309
When I was in Florida
last week...

1210
00:54:37,409 --> 00:54:38,949
I ran into a man...

1211
00:54:39,049 --> 00:54:42,389
who heard from someone
who knew someone.

1212
00:54:42,489 --> 00:54:46,500
Anyway, it seems Max
has some secret from his past.

1213
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:49,070
You're talking about my Max?

1214
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:50,549
A dark secret.

1215
00:54:50,649 --> 00:54:52,669
- What kind of a dark secret?
- Dark.

1216
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:54,909
What is by you dark?

1217
00:54:55,009 --> 00:54:56,109
I don't know.

1218
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,829
What kind of a dark secret?

1219
00:54:57,929 --> 00:55:00,389
We have been married
for 30 years.

1220
00:55:00,489 --> 00:55:01,989
You're his first wife?

1221
00:55:02,089 --> 00:55:03,509
Sure.

1222
00:55:03,609 --> 00:55:04,990
Before me, he worked for...

1223
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:06,910
All right.

1224
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:09,189
What?

1225
00:55:09,289 --> 00:55:10,350
You heard something different?

1226
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:12,209
I heard only a dark secret.

1227
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,630
Do I know what dark secret?

1228
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:15,099
Who told you?

1229
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,669
Wolf Fishbein.

1230
00:55:18,769 --> 00:55:20,669
Be careful.

1231
00:55:20,769 --> 00:55:22,594
That's all I want to say.

1232
00:55:23,258 --> 00:55:26,041
<i>Dolly tried putting</i>
<i>Elsie's words out of her mind...</i>

1233
00:55:26,168 --> 00:55:28,747
<i>but Max's dark secret</i>
<i>plagued her.</i>

1234
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,989
<i>Then one day,</i>
<i>she ran into Wolf Fishbein...</i>

1235
00:55:32,117 --> 00:55:34,440
<i>and the truth was revealed.</i>

1236
00:55:34,721 --> 00:55:36,550
Try to breathe deeply.

1237
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:39,368
You were right.

1238
00:55:39,597 --> 00:55:41,206
Fishbein told me a tale.

1239
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:45,265
Max, before I met him,
he lived in Florida.

1240
00:55:45,393 --> 00:55:49,376
He had a store...groceries.

1241
00:55:49,529 --> 00:55:51,589
He was married.

1242
00:55:51,689 --> 00:55:52,780
Now it comes out.

1243
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:57,309
To a woman with two children.

1244
00:55:57,409 --> 00:55:59,269
Max had other children?

1245
00:55:59,369 --> 00:56:03,460
The woman's children,
from a prior marriage.

1246
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:09,149
He began an affair
with the downstairs neighbor...

1247
00:56:09,249 --> 00:56:10,430
a widow.

1248
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:12,540
He probably had
all his hair then.

1249
00:56:13,659 --> 00:56:18,389
Meanwhile, he got into debt
deeper and deeper...

1250
00:56:18,489 --> 00:56:21,349
and carry on with the neighbor.

1251
00:56:21,449 --> 00:56:22,820
My heart.

1252
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,740
He can't get himself
out of a predicament.

1253
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:31,469
What does he do?

1254
00:56:31,569 --> 00:56:33,229
He stole money.

1255
00:56:33,329 --> 00:56:35,189
I should be so lucky.

1256
00:56:35,289 --> 00:56:37,060
He killed his wife.

1257
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,149
The man purchased an ax.

1258
00:56:42,249 --> 00:56:43,350
With an ax?

1259
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:44,589
You know Max.

1260
00:56:44,689 --> 00:56:46,149
He's nothing with tools.

1261
00:56:46,249 --> 00:56:48,469
He can't even hang a picture.

1262
00:56:48,569 --> 00:56:50,029
I'm dropping dead.

1263
00:56:50,129 --> 00:56:52,060
Plus her children.

1264
00:56:53,219 --> 00:56:54,710
Plus a neighbor.

1265
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:58,989
Four people he killed
one night with an ax.

1266
00:56:59,089 --> 00:57:01,149
Your Max?

1267
00:57:01,249 --> 00:57:02,829
This is not the capper.

1268
00:57:02,929 --> 00:57:04,429
There's more?

1269
00:57:04,529 --> 00:57:05,699
More.

1270
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,939
What more?

1271
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,469
He ate them.

1272
00:57:11,569 --> 00:57:13,069
Are you talking crazy?

1273
00:57:13,169 --> 00:57:16,390
He devoured them.

1274
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:18,549
I can't breathe.

1275
00:57:18,649 --> 00:57:20,429
Everything is closing in.

1276
00:57:20,529 --> 00:57:24,389
Whatever you do,
first, hear Max's side.

1277
00:57:24,489 --> 00:57:26,429
Max has a side?

1278
00:57:26,529 --> 00:57:29,069
He kills his family
and eats them up.

1279
00:57:29,169 --> 00:57:30,469
The man has a side?

1280
00:57:30,569 --> 00:57:34,469
He was a good husband and
a loving father for 30 years.

1281
00:57:34,569 --> 00:57:36,509
You have a daughter
who went to college.

1282
00:57:36,609 --> 00:57:38,220
You have a son who's a writer.

1283
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:43,580
Maybe the best course of action
is let sleeping dogs lie.

1284
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:47,099
Honey, would you pass
the sour cream?

1285
00:57:51,899 --> 00:57:54,300
You haven't touched a thing.

1286
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:56,859
Nice weather!

1287
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,069
It's OK.

1288
00:57:59,169 --> 00:58:00,850
It's not just OK.

1289
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:02,129
It's nice!

1290
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:03,570
All right, all right.

1291
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:05,630
What are you getting
so steamed up about?

1292
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:08,049
What makes you such
an authority on the weather?

1293
00:58:08,149 --> 00:58:09,490
Me?

1294
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:10,929
All I said...

1295
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,849
I know, I know.
I know what you said.

1296
00:58:12,949 --> 00:58:14,769
The fish is delicious.

1297
00:58:14,869 --> 00:58:16,789
Wouldn't you rather have meat?

1298
00:58:16,889 --> 00:58:18,749
Since when do I eat meat?

1299
00:58:18,849 --> 00:58:19,869
Mm-hmm.

1300
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:22,610
With my arteries, you gotta
watch out for cholesterol.

1301
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:23,890
Uh-huh.

1302
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:26,770
What is the "uh-huh"?

1303
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,389
I mean, you've been
very touchy lately.

1304
00:58:29,489 --> 00:58:31,430
Don't interrogate me...

1305
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:33,420
Mr. Max Pinchuck!

1306
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:42,110
Where did you hear that name?

1307
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:44,829
Did you kill your first wife
with an ax?

1308
00:58:44,929 --> 00:58:47,429
I got a headache.

1309
00:58:47,529 --> 00:58:50,059
Did you chop her up
along with your mistress?

1310
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:57,009
If I tell you why I did it,
do you promise not to nudge me?

1311
00:58:57,109 --> 00:58:59,909
Wolf Fishbein said
in order to hide the bodies...

1312
00:59:00,009 --> 00:59:02,069
you ate them!

1313
00:59:02,169 --> 00:59:05,189
So what are you making a fuss?

1314
00:59:05,289 --> 00:59:07,269
Some bury, some burn.

1315
00:59:07,369 --> 00:59:08,389
I ate.

1316
00:59:08,489 --> 00:59:09,669
Enough!

1317
00:59:09,769 --> 00:59:11,909
I remember
"Max Pincus' Dark Secret".

1318
00:59:12,009 --> 00:59:13,349
That is a disgraceful story.

1319
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:15,429
You don't see your sick view
of our parents?

1320
00:59:15,529 --> 00:59:17,189
I wrote it when I was younger.

1321
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:19,430
The first of a number
of anti-Semitic pieces.

1322
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:21,509
Here he is,
direct from the Wailing Wall.

1323
00:59:21,609 --> 00:59:23,429
Disrespectful, shameful.

1324
00:59:23,529 --> 00:59:24,869
Jews haven't suffered enough...

1325
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:27,549
without being depicted by him
as homicidal cannibals.

1326
00:59:27,649 --> 00:59:28,989
He has no spiritual center.

1327
00:59:29,089 --> 00:59:30,909
He's betting everything
on physics and pussy!

1328
00:59:31,009 --> 00:59:32,629
Excuse the expression.

1329
00:59:32,729 --> 00:59:33,950
Wait till he gets cancer.

1330
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:35,869
He'll be the first one
in synagogue...

1331
00:59:35,969 --> 00:59:37,469
in the front row in a yarmulke.

1332
00:59:37,569 --> 00:59:39,549
Why should I get cancer?
I eat broccoli.

1333
00:59:39,649 --> 00:59:41,469
Do you care even
about the holocaust...

1334
00:59:41,569 --> 00:59:42,909
or do you think
it never happened?

1335
00:59:43,009 --> 00:59:45,309
Not only do I know
that we lost six million...

1336
00:59:45,409 --> 00:59:49,269
but the scary thing is that
records are made to be broken.

1337
00:59:49,369 --> 00:59:51,549
I know what's out there.
Do you have any idea?

1338
00:59:51,649 --> 00:59:53,629
He creates offensive
Jewish stereotypes...

1339
00:59:53,729 --> 00:59:55,069
Like in "Der Sturmer".

1340
00:59:55,169 --> 00:59:57,789
Max is a version of Daddy...
a man you hated...

1341
00:59:57,889 --> 01:00:00,829
a man you think was guilty
of being a terrible parent.

1342
01:00:00,929 --> 01:00:02,459
He was a terrible parent.

1343
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,149
Thank you for dropping by.

1344
01:00:05,249 --> 01:00:07,150
Please come again
in another four years.

1345
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,989
Look, wouldn't it be
a better world...

1346
01:00:09,089 --> 01:00:12,349
if not every group thought
they had a direct line to God?

1347
01:00:12,449 --> 01:00:15,229
He thinks
I'm all Jewish paranoia.

1348
01:00:15,329 --> 01:00:16,669
No, I don't think
you're paranoid.

1349
01:00:16,769 --> 01:00:18,589
I think you're the opposite
of a paranoid.

1350
01:00:18,689 --> 01:00:21,500
You go around with the insane
delusion that people like you.

1351
01:00:30,899 --> 01:00:31,864
What's the matter?

1352
01:00:31,964 --> 01:00:33,230
You son of a bitch!

1353
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:34,280
What's wrong?

1354
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,110
You sick, sick, sick...

1355
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:37,549
sick fucking bastard!

1356
01:00:37,649 --> 01:00:38,900
What's wrong?

1357
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:41,549
What do you think is wrong?

1358
01:00:41,649 --> 01:00:44,109
You've been having an affair
with one of my patients.

1359
01:00:44,209 --> 01:00:45,229
Who?

1360
01:00:45,329 --> 01:00:48,109
Don't act like you don't know
what I'm talking about!

1361
01:00:48,209 --> 01:00:49,229
Don't speak!

1362
01:00:49,329 --> 01:00:51,310
I just talked to her.
She told me the whole thing.

1363
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,410
Who? Who?

1364
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,270
Mrs. Pollack. Amy Pollack.

1365
01:00:56,370 --> 01:00:57,709
Can I explain something?

1366
01:00:57,809 --> 01:00:58,829
You know Amy Pollack?

1367
01:00:58,929 --> 01:01:00,830
Don't explain anything,
you little fucking asshole!

1368
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:02,189
Will you calm down?

1369
01:01:02,289 --> 01:01:04,429
Don't you tell me to calm down!

1370
01:01:04,529 --> 01:01:06,830
- What's wrong?
- What is wrong?

1371
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:09,710
I treat this woman
and she exits...

1372
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:12,590
and you meet her
and you fuck her!

1373
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:14,989
Supposing I told you
that my fucking Amy Pollack...

1374
01:01:15,089 --> 01:01:18,350
was a disguised plea
for more closeness with you?

1375
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:21,109
Then I'd say
you are a mental case.

1376
01:01:21,209 --> 01:01:22,590
This is you
with your first wife.

1377
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:23,710
You're crazy.

1378
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:26,150
You were claiming you loved her,
couldn't live without her...

1379
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,530
all the while you're having
affair after affair.

1380
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:31,869
My first wife, I told you,
I was laying in bed with her...

1381
01:01:31,969 --> 01:01:35,090
I turned off her because the way
the light struck her.

1382
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:37,010
Suddenly she looked to me
like Max Schmeling.

1383
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,070
What do you want me to say?

1384
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:41,970
Not that she wasn't pretty,
but she looked like Schmeling.

1385
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:43,249
I couldn't get an erection.

1386
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:45,009
Stop this tap-dancing!
This is bullshit!

1387
01:01:45,109 --> 01:01:46,770
It's not bullshit.

1388
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,490
With you, it's different.
You turned off me.

1389
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:51,410
Ever since Hilly was born.

1390
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:54,290
We've been living like siblings.
It's been platonic.

1391
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:55,829
Don't play "blame the victim"!

1392
01:01:55,929 --> 01:01:57,229
What are you talking about?

1393
01:01:57,329 --> 01:02:00,109
I'm as much a victim as you.

1394
01:02:00,209 --> 01:02:02,589
You think that getting
a blow job...

1395
01:02:02,689 --> 01:02:06,350
from a big-bosomed 26-year-old
is a pleasurable thing for me?

1396
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:07,870
You're making me sick!

1397
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:10,669
I can't believe
this is happening.

1398
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:11,789
You're overreacting.

1399
01:02:11,889 --> 01:02:13,229
I'm not overreacting!

1400
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:15,089
Are you trying to tell me...

1401
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:17,009
that every week
for the last four months...

1402
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:19,829
you've been with her
in the hotel?

1403
01:02:19,929 --> 01:02:22,229
Oh, that's so crazy.
No, of course not!

1404
01:02:22,329 --> 01:02:24,389
I rented an apartment.

1405
01:02:24,489 --> 01:02:26,300
I'm gonna kill you!

1406
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:32,209
Hello, doctor.
I'm sorry I'm late.

1407
01:02:32,309 --> 01:02:33,249
Mr. Farber.

1408
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:35,139
Take off your coat. Come in.

1409
01:02:49,539 --> 01:02:50,930
I've been...

1410
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:52,850
I've been losing sleep at night.

1411
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:54,770
I can't shut my eyes at night.

1412
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:57,169
I think I should quit my job...

1413
01:02:57,269 --> 01:03:00,149
but I can't
bring myself to do it.

1414
01:03:00,249 --> 01:03:03,029
Maybe because my brother-in-law
treats me kindly.

1415
01:03:03,129 --> 01:03:04,949
But working for him...

1416
01:03:05,049 --> 01:03:07,250
is taking its toll on me
emotionally.

1417
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,170
Could you excuse me, Mr. Farber?

1418
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:10,340
What?

1419
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:16,109
You fucked-up fuck!

1420
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,309
I can't believe
you fucking did this!

1421
01:03:18,409 --> 01:03:19,590
You fucking asshole!

1422
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:21,510
You fucked my patient?

1423
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:23,590
Harry, you don't fuck
somebody's patient!

1424
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:25,140
Fuck you!

1425
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:36,059
Continue, Mr. Farber.

1426
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:41,749
You lost your thread?

1427
01:03:41,849 --> 01:03:43,669
You were talking about
quitting your job.

1428
01:03:43,769 --> 01:03:45,499
Oh. Right.

1429
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:50,389
I discussed it with my wife.

1430
01:03:50,489 --> 01:03:53,269
While she seems on the surface
to be supportive...

1431
01:03:53,369 --> 01:03:55,189
I know she'd rather I stay on.

1432
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:57,109
She idolizes Gordon.

1433
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:59,029
I mean, all the time...

1434
01:03:59,129 --> 01:04:01,909
that's all she does
is spend time with him anyway.

1435
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:04,629
Listen, could you excuse me
just one more second?

1436
01:04:04,729 --> 01:04:05,830
Again?

1437
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:08,580
Just continue. I can hear you
from the hallway. Loudly.

1438
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,709
I want you to get out of here.

1439
01:04:12,809 --> 01:04:15,389
I want you to get
your goddamn stuff together...

1440
01:04:15,489 --> 01:04:16,829
and I want you out.

1441
01:04:16,929 --> 01:04:18,749
You know, I cannot understand...

1442
01:04:18,849 --> 01:04:20,829
why the most sophisticated
of women...

1443
01:04:20,929 --> 01:04:22,430
can't tell the difference...

1444
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:25,469
between a meaningless,
hot, passionate sexual affair...

1445
01:04:25,569 --> 01:04:27,869
and a nice, solid,
tranquil, routine marriage.

1446
01:04:27,969 --> 01:04:29,789
Harry, just tell me something.

1447
01:04:29,889 --> 01:04:32,030
Was she the only one,
or were there others?

1448
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,950
No, Amy Pollack
was the only one.

1449
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:35,430
May God strike me dead
if I'm lying.

1450
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:37,469
You're an atheist, Harry!

1451
01:04:37,569 --> 01:04:40,349
We're alone in the universe.
Gonna blame that on me, too?

1452
01:04:40,449 --> 01:04:42,109
- Stop that tap-dancing!
- Stop that!

1453
01:04:42,209 --> 01:04:44,389
You know,
you turned off me first.

1454
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:46,469
Oh, please!

1455
01:04:46,569 --> 01:04:47,909
No, I gave birth.

1456
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:51,269
When women give birth,
there is a time period...

1457
01:04:51,369 --> 01:04:53,259
when their hormones
just sort of go crazy.

1458
01:04:54,219 --> 01:04:55,389
But they settle.

1459
01:04:55,489 --> 01:04:57,950
OK, so you're telling me
that you're settling.

1460
01:04:58,050 --> 01:05:00,509
- I accept that.
- You accept that?

1461
01:05:00,609 --> 01:05:02,909
Oh, Harry,
you are so fucking nuts!

1462
01:05:03,009 --> 01:05:04,829
Take it easy.

1463
01:05:04,929 --> 01:05:09,309
Harry, if you're not happy
in a marriage, you don't cheat.

1464
01:05:09,409 --> 01:05:11,069
And with my patient?

1465
01:05:11,169 --> 01:05:13,949
That is a sacred trust.
My patient.

1466
01:05:14,049 --> 01:05:16,029
What do you want?
Who else do I meet?

1467
01:05:16,129 --> 01:05:18,189
I'm here, working in the room,
we have the baby...

1468
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:20,699
you're out there practicing,
we never socialize.

1469
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:22,989
So now you're blaming me...

1470
01:05:23,089 --> 01:05:25,390
because I don't go out with you
enough places...

1471
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:27,299
where you can meet strangers
to fuck?

1472
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:36,309
I was merely explaining to you
why my choice, of necessity...

1473
01:05:36,409 --> 01:05:38,219
is confined to your practice.

1474
01:05:40,339 --> 01:05:42,449
I knew you were mentally ill
before I married you...

1475
01:05:42,549 --> 01:05:45,069
but I thought because
I was a trained professional...

1476
01:05:45,169 --> 01:05:46,660
that I could help you.

1477
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,829
The last thing you wanna do...

1478
01:05:50,929 --> 01:05:53,020
is get down on yourself
as a therapist.

1479
01:05:55,379 --> 01:05:58,830
I want you to get your shit
and get your goddamn clothes...

1480
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:01,229
and I want you to get
the fuck out of here!

1481
01:06:01,329 --> 01:06:03,630
You are the most fucking
irresponsible person...

1482
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:05,710
I've ever seen
in my entire life!

1483
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:07,380
And get out!

1484
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,099
Continue, Mr. Farber.

1485
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,089
Doctor...

1486
01:06:15,189 --> 01:06:18,500
And I mean tonight,
motherfucker!

1487
01:06:25,539 --> 01:06:27,300
Dad, my Pepsi.

1488
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,530
So you got even
with your ex-wife...

1489
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:38,589
and with your sister,
and I was born?

1490
01:06:38,689 --> 01:06:40,049
Born? What are you saying?

1491
01:06:40,149 --> 01:06:42,590
From your pen.
From your fertile imagination.

1492
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:44,189
And I mean imagination.

1493
01:06:44,289 --> 01:06:46,269
I wasn't trying
to get even with Joan.

1494
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:49,010
You created me
as the shrewish Jewish hybrid...

1495
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:50,589
who goes off
with another patient...

1496
01:06:50,689 --> 01:06:53,150
an orthodox divorcee
from Tel Aviv.

1497
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:55,230
My sister never should have
married Burt.

1498
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:57,309
This guy's turned her
into a zealot.

1499
01:06:57,409 --> 01:06:58,429
She loves you.

1500
01:06:58,529 --> 01:07:00,690
It wasn't her fault
your father persecuted you.

1501
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:02,750
She was fine
till she wound up with him...

1502
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:04,690
this right-wing hawk
that she's married.

1503
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:05,790
Listen to him.

1504
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:08,530
So she disappointed you
in her choice of husbands?

1505
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:10,109
Well, fuck you. She loves Burt.

1506
01:07:10,209 --> 01:07:12,849
She was a wonderful kid.
She had a flair for physics.

1507
01:07:12,949 --> 01:07:14,509
Suddenly overnight,
she's kosher.

1508
01:07:14,609 --> 01:07:15,949
She loves you still...

1509
01:07:16,049 --> 01:07:18,829
despite your obvious
condescension towards her life.

1510
01:07:18,929 --> 01:07:20,030
Does she love me?

1511
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:22,510
Would you like to hear
what she says about you?

1512
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:23,909
He's not so bad, Burt.

1513
01:07:24,009 --> 01:07:25,810
He really was
a very good brother.

1514
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:28,530
Just my father never forgave him
when his wife died.

1515
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:29,969
The man is not a Jewish man.

1516
01:07:30,069 --> 01:07:31,889
He's not a Jewish man.
That's all.

1517
01:07:31,989 --> 01:07:33,470
All right. Poor Harry.

1518
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:35,250
He was always lost.

1519
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:37,170
He could just never
accept the fact...

1520
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:39,229
that there are things
you can't know.

1521
01:07:39,329 --> 01:07:42,130
The man is incapable
of an act of faith.

1522
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:44,050
For that, I pity him.

1523
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:46,930
I would like to hug him again
like when we were kids.

1524
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:49,539
And if I was upset,
he was a comfort to me.

1525
01:07:50,179 --> 01:07:51,709
What happens to us?

1526
01:07:51,809 --> 01:07:52,759
Doris...

1527
01:07:52,859 --> 01:07:54,179
She can't hear you.

1528
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,750
And as for Joan...

1529
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:59,670
Joan? Joan hates me.

1530
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:01,109
Well, shouldn't she?

1531
01:08:01,209 --> 01:08:04,029
Why should she hate me,
because I was unfaithful to her?

1532
01:08:04,129 --> 01:08:06,550
No, because when she caught you,
you weren't a man.

1533
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:09,430
You turned
into this double-talking...

1534
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:12,150
wise-cracking, tap-dancing liar.

1535
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:14,230
If she had not become
so enraged...

1536
01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:15,829
maybe we could've
patched things up.

1537
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:17,650
Listen to this guy. Deluded.

1538
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:19,990
Maybe it tapered a bit
after Hilly was born...

1539
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:21,949
but you two had sex
pretty regularly.

1540
01:08:22,049 --> 01:08:24,629
I have no idea
why I took up with that patient.

1541
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:26,710
She was available,
she was adorable.

1542
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:28,630
And my marriage
was droning on.

1543
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,349
What you call "droning on,"
most people call "working."

1544
01:08:31,449 --> 01:08:33,749
If that's "working",
then marriage is not for me.

1545
01:08:33,849 --> 01:08:35,189
Well, it's not for everyone.

1546
01:08:35,289 --> 01:08:37,010
But then I get lonely.

1547
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:39,109
Hey, what do you want me to say?

1548
01:08:39,209 --> 01:08:40,949
She gave me Hilly...

1549
01:08:41,049 --> 01:08:42,869
and for that
I'm eternally grateful...

1550
01:08:42,969 --> 01:08:44,950
'cause I love him so much.

1551
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:46,709
You can have any one
you want here.

1552
01:08:46,809 --> 01:08:48,149
Can I get two?

1553
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:49,269
You can get two.

1554
01:08:49,369 --> 01:08:51,189
Tell you what,
you get any three presents.

1555
01:08:51,289 --> 01:08:53,590
Go through the store
and pick any three presents, OK?

1556
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:54,709
Yeah.

1557
01:08:54,809 --> 01:08:55,829
Look what I found.

1558
01:08:55,929 --> 01:08:56,949
Hey.

1559
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:59,189
This is the chemistry set
you always wanted.

1560
01:08:59,289 --> 01:09:01,109
Look at that. It's perfect.

1561
01:09:01,209 --> 01:09:02,949
No, no. Don't open it here.

1562
01:09:03,049 --> 01:09:05,899
Let me buy it first, OK?
So I don't get into...

1563
01:09:09,099 --> 01:09:10,149
How you doing?

1564
01:09:10,249 --> 01:09:11,749
Larry, what are you doing here?

1565
01:09:11,849 --> 01:09:13,190
Buying my nephew
a Power Ranger.

1566
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:15,270
When did you get back?

1567
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:16,869
A couple of days ago.

1568
01:09:16,969 --> 01:09:18,869
Hey, Fay.

1569
01:09:18,969 --> 01:09:20,870
Meet Larry.
I told you about Larry.

1570
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:22,950
Oh, yeah.
It's nice to meet you.

1571
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:24,229
Old friend, colleague, peer.

1572
01:09:24,329 --> 01:09:25,349
Right.

1573
01:09:25,449 --> 01:09:26,630
So you got back when?

1574
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:29,029
Two days ago.
I took a boat down the Amazon.

1575
01:09:29,129 --> 01:09:30,470
Really?
God, that sounds exciting.

1576
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:32,869
Yes, if you don't mind
malaria and dysentery.

1577
01:09:32,969 --> 01:09:34,789
Butterflies the size of doves.

1578
01:09:34,889 --> 01:09:36,549
Never seen anything like it
before.

1579
01:09:36,649 --> 01:09:38,629
I can live without that,
however.

1580
01:09:38,729 --> 01:09:39,909
It was astounding.

1581
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,509
It sounds it.

1582
01:09:41,609 --> 01:09:44,229
So you got back two days ago?

1583
01:09:44,329 --> 01:09:46,309
We go back a long way.

1584
01:09:46,409 --> 01:09:48,549
We both started out
wanting to be Kafka...

1585
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:50,629
and you got slightly closer
than me.

1586
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:52,819
Yeah, I became the insect
and he...

1587
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:55,269
Good. I'm amazed.

1588
01:09:55,369 --> 01:09:56,709
We should go out.

1589
01:09:56,809 --> 01:10:00,189
Why don't you come to my house
in East Hampton for a weekend?

1590
01:10:00,289 --> 01:10:01,470
It will be great fun.

1591
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:02,909
Well, let's not get hysterical.

1592
01:10:03,009 --> 01:10:05,310
No, I'd love to.
It would be fun.

1593
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:06,589
Oh, it's beautiful out there.

1594
01:10:06,689 --> 01:10:08,350
It's sand in the crotch.
It's ticks.

1595
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:10,229
To get this guy
to leave his room...

1596
01:10:10,329 --> 01:10:12,990
He's never had a tan.

1597
01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:15,869
I've always wanted to learn
how to snorkel.

1598
01:10:15,969 --> 01:10:16,990
Oh, it's great there.

1599
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:19,229
Where he lives there are sharks.

1600
01:10:19,329 --> 01:10:20,369
You see those photographs...

1601
01:10:20,469 --> 01:10:22,589
of guys with stumps
for legs and arms?

1602
01:10:22,689 --> 01:10:23,710
Am I lying?

1603
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:25,149
Yes, you are. It's fabulous.

1604
01:10:25,249 --> 01:10:26,590
Let me buy dinner. We'll talk.

1605
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:28,189
No, we'll buy dinner.

1606
01:10:28,289 --> 01:10:30,269
I'd love to tell you
about the Amazon.

1607
01:10:30,369 --> 01:10:31,709
It changed my life.

1608
01:10:31,809 --> 01:10:33,149
It sounds amazing.

1609
01:10:33,249 --> 01:10:35,230
Gonna write a novel.
I'll tell you.

1610
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:38,269
I'm not into the Amazon.
You know what the Amazon is?

1611
01:10:38,369 --> 01:10:40,349
The Amazon
is the tiny, little heads...

1612
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:41,789
with the lips sewn together.

1613
01:10:41,889 --> 01:10:43,419
Can you picture him this way?

1614
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,750
That's great.
We'll go to dinner tonight.

1615
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:48,189
- Yeah, great.
- That'd be great.

1616
01:10:48,289 --> 01:10:50,979
Great. I'm single, available,
with the soul of a black man.

1617
01:10:52,099 --> 01:10:54,269
Do you smell sulfur?

1618
01:10:54,369 --> 01:10:56,700
Hilly, did you open
the chemistry set?

1619
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:59,749
Hey, look.
We're almost there.

1620
01:10:59,849 --> 01:11:01,869
Hilly. Hilly, wake up.
We're almost...

1621
01:11:01,969 --> 01:11:04,430
Hilly, wake up.
We're almost at the university.

1622
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:06,189
Your dad's gonna be honored...

1623
01:11:06,289 --> 01:11:08,109
limited as my curriculum was.

1624
01:11:08,209 --> 01:11:09,230
Richard, we're there.

1625
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:10,739
Hey, honey. Wake up.

1626
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:13,389
Something's wrong.

1627
01:11:13,489 --> 01:11:14,829
What's the matter?

1628
01:11:14,929 --> 01:11:17,109
I don't think he's breathing.

1629
01:11:17,209 --> 01:11:19,589
He's dead!

1630
01:11:19,689 --> 01:11:20,910
I can't believe this.

1631
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,509
We were at the doctor's
yesterday.

1632
01:11:22,609 --> 01:11:23,949
They said his heart was fine.

1633
01:11:24,049 --> 01:11:25,069
I'm scared.

1634
01:11:25,169 --> 01:11:26,590
There's nothing
to be scared of, Hilly.

1635
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:27,660
I'm fine, dad.

1636
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,350
Remember I told you death
is a natural part of life?

1637
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:31,949
You have to embrace them both.

1638
01:11:32,049 --> 01:11:33,230
What are we gonna do?

1639
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:35,310
I don't know.
Get back in the car.

1640
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:36,740
I don't wanna sit next to him!

1641
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:43,819
Welcome to Adair University.

1642
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:47,309
We certainly hope
you had a pleasant trip.

1643
01:11:47,409 --> 01:11:48,909
Would you like to rest up?

1644
01:11:49,009 --> 01:11:50,989
Would you like
some refreshments, perhaps?

1645
01:11:51,089 --> 01:11:52,340
Is he all right?

1646
01:11:52,819 --> 01:11:55,470
He's dead, honey.
You got one of them rubber bags?

1647
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:57,709
We've made arrangements...

1648
01:11:57,809 --> 01:12:00,580
for the body to be delivered
to New York City.

1649
01:12:02,699 --> 01:12:06,340
I don't think he has
any immediate family, actually.

1650
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:10,659
If you prefer,
we can call off the proceedings.

1651
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,860
I think that's the best idea.

1652
01:12:15,219 --> 01:12:17,580
He'll be all right.
He's here for a purpose.

1653
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:22,459
You know, I...

1654
01:12:23,139 --> 01:12:24,670
I'll see that...

1655
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:27,309
that he's, you know...

1656
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:29,789
that the funeral comes off
and all that.

1657
01:12:29,889 --> 01:12:33,069
I'll see that he's buried
properly.

1658
01:12:33,169 --> 01:12:34,860
I understand.

1659
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:41,699
Poor Richard.
Oh, Jesus. The poor guy!

1660
01:12:44,659 --> 01:12:46,989
I'm not gonna make it.
I can't go on.

1661
01:12:47,089 --> 01:12:49,069
Not if you keep drinking
and popping pills.

1662
01:12:49,169 --> 01:12:50,929
Oh, Jesus.
I can't believe this.

1663
01:12:51,029 --> 01:12:52,790
My old school
wants to honor me...

1664
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:54,710
I show up with a hooker
and a dead body.

1665
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:55,830
Take it easy.

1666
01:12:55,930 --> 01:12:57,929
You're getting yourself
all wound up about nothing.

1667
01:12:58,029 --> 01:12:59,410
- Cookie, look at me!
- What?

1668
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:01,389
Look! Look!
I'm out of focus!

1669
01:13:01,489 --> 01:13:04,349
You're a little pale,
but you're all right.

1670
01:13:04,449 --> 01:13:06,230
I'm out of focus. I'm soft.

1671
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:08,589
You better calm down.
They'll be here any minute.

1672
01:13:08,689 --> 01:13:10,449
No, no. It's so humiliating.

1673
01:13:10,549 --> 01:13:12,509
They're gonna honor me,
and I'm a blob.

1674
01:13:12,609 --> 01:13:14,339
You look fine. Don't worry.

1675
01:13:15,259 --> 01:13:16,969
I'll be sitting on the dais.
They're eating.

1676
01:13:17,069 --> 01:13:18,450
They'll get seasick.
They'll throw up.

1677
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:20,630
Hold my hand. Now relax.

1678
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:23,510
You drive all the way here so
your son can see you honored...

1679
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:25,590
and you make a jackass
out of yourself.

1680
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:28,190
But don't you see?
I'm a huge blur.

1681
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:30,429
You're gonna be all right.
I'm gonna talk you down.

1682
01:13:30,529 --> 01:13:32,509
I have seen
all kinds of guys O.D.

1683
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:34,989
Heroin, acid, crack.
You name it.

1684
01:13:35,089 --> 01:13:36,430
I didn't take any of that stuff.

1685
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:38,350
Yeah, but you're a pill-popper.

1686
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:40,629
That's not what it is, Cookie.
It's me.

1687
01:13:40,729 --> 01:13:43,150
I'm O.D.ing on myself.
It's that I'm a shit.

1688
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:44,309
Have some black coffee.

1689
01:13:44,409 --> 01:13:46,109
I don't want anything.

1690
01:13:46,209 --> 01:13:49,389
Talk to me about something.
You like sports?

1691
01:13:49,489 --> 01:13:50,769
Yeah. I was a pitcher.

1692
01:13:50,869 --> 01:13:54,110
When a guy crowded the plate,
I used to throw at his head,

1693
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:56,050
'cause I'm the worst person
in the world.

1694
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:57,489
Honey, I've seen worse.

1695
01:13:57,589 --> 01:13:58,930
Who's worse than me?

1696
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:00,209
Hitler.

1697
01:14:00,309 --> 01:14:01,790
All right. Maybe Hitler.

1698
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:03,250
Maybe Hitler, Goering,
and Goebbels,

1699
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:05,169
but I'm fourth,
right behind them.

1700
01:14:05,269 --> 01:14:06,610
Come on, hold my hand.

1701
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:08,049
Can you feel my hand?

1702
01:14:08,149 --> 01:14:09,089
Yes, it's warm.

1703
01:14:09,189 --> 01:14:10,929
See? It's just panic.

1704
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:12,370
You're not a blob.

1705
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:13,900
I know.
I'm gonna get over this.

1706
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:17,150
I'm having a panic attack.
I have these attacks.

1707
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,609
What sports do you like?

1708
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:20,529
I like them all.

1709
01:14:20,629 --> 01:14:21,970
I like baseball.
I like basketball.

1710
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:23,890
I was married to a woman,
Cookie, who...

1711
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:25,810
she looked like Max Schmeling.

1712
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:27,939
No, I'm not joking.

1713
01:14:28,899 --> 01:14:30,220
All right, it's time.

1714
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,969
I can't get through this
without you.

1715
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:35,410
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry.

1716
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:36,829
If you didn't come
with me today...

1717
01:14:36,929 --> 01:14:38,860
Don't worry about it.
Straighten up.

1718
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:42,130
I gotta get a tie.
I gotta get my tie.

1719
01:14:42,230 --> 01:14:43,420
All right. Let's go.

1720
01:14:47,419 --> 01:14:50,910
Are you ready to be
immortalized by Adair?

1721
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:52,370
I teach your books.

1722
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:54,069
These are some
of my literature students.

1723
01:14:54,169 --> 01:14:56,549
We all know all your work,
your characters...

1724
01:14:56,649 --> 01:14:58,149
even the obscure ones.

1725
01:14:58,249 --> 01:15:00,069
Good reading is a creative act.

1726
01:15:00,169 --> 01:15:01,749
So are you working
on anything now?

1727
01:15:01,849 --> 01:15:04,149
Something we can look forward
to sinking our teeth into?

1728
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:07,989
I'm in the midst of writing
a thing on the devil...

1729
01:15:08,089 --> 01:15:11,349
who comes and kidnaps
a man's one true love...

1730
01:15:11,449 --> 01:15:13,950
and takes her down to hell,
and he goes to retrieve her.

1731
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:18,299
Since it's hell, I'm able
to settle a lot of old scores.

1732
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:20,629
What's the man like?

1733
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:22,430
It's me, thinly disguised.

1734
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:26,710
In fact, I don't even think
I should disguise it anymore.

1735
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:28,886
It's, you know, it's me.

1736
01:15:30,061 --> 01:15:33,278
<i>Floor five: subway muggers,</i>
<i>aggressive panhandlers...</i>

1737
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:34,580
<i>and book critics.</i>

1738
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:38,709
<i>Floor six: Right-wing</i>
<i>extremists, serial killers...</i>

1739
01:15:38,809 --> 01:15:40,699
<i>lawyers</i>
<i>who appear on television.</i>

1740
01:15:41,626 --> 01:15:43,745
<i>Floor seven: the media.</i>

1741
01:15:43,898 --> 01:15:45,915
<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>That floor is all filled up.</i>

1742
01:15:46,502 --> 01:15:48,829
<i>Floor eight:</i>
<i>escaped war criminals...</i>

1743
01:15:48,929 --> 01:15:50,970
<i>TV evangelists, and the NRA.</i>

1744
01:15:51,557 --> 01:15:54,085
<i>Lowest level. Everybody off.</i>

1745
01:16:24,579 --> 01:16:25,829
What did you do?

1746
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:27,780
I invented aluminum siding.

1747
01:16:44,459 --> 01:16:45,469
Dad.

1748
01:16:45,569 --> 01:16:47,389
Get me out of here!
This is terrible!

1749
01:16:47,489 --> 01:16:49,670
You know how
I could never stand hot weather.

1750
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:51,109
What is this man doing here?

1751
01:16:51,209 --> 01:16:52,869
He's condemned
to eternal suffering.

1752
01:16:52,969 --> 01:16:54,309
Harry, help me.

1753
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:57,656
I don't understand.
I demand to know the charges.

1754
01:16:57,758 --> 01:16:59,749
"He behaved unconscionably
toward his son..."

1755
01:16:59,849 --> 01:17:01,709
"accused the boy
of committing a capital crime..."

1756
01:17:01,809 --> 01:17:03,309
"merely by being born."

1757
01:17:03,409 --> 01:17:05,990
"Your wife,
they told me, is dead..."

1758
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:07,940
"but your son, he's thriving."

1759
01:17:08,459 --> 01:17:10,259
Why did he fight not to be born?

1760
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,379
Look, I forgive him.

1761
01:17:15,059 --> 01:17:16,659
What's over is over.

1762
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:20,390
It's finished.
Let him go to heaven, please?

1763
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:22,380
I'm a Jew.
We don't believe in heaven.

1764
01:17:23,379 --> 01:17:24,690
Where do you wanna go?

1765
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:26,629
To a Chinese restaurant.

1766
01:17:26,729 --> 01:17:28,070
Take him to Joy Luck.

1767
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:30,099
I love him despite everything.

1768
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:52,059
Looking for someone?

1769
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:55,869
I'm here to get Fay.

1770
01:17:55,969 --> 01:17:57,909
She's not coming with you.

1771
01:17:58,009 --> 01:17:59,230
What are you telling me?

1772
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:01,230
Because you're the head
of this whole underworld...

1773
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:03,750
that you can just abduct her
and get away with it?

1774
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:06,910
I'm gonna kidnap her back.
What are you laughing?

1775
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:08,909
You dare to match your powers
against mine?

1776
01:18:09,009 --> 01:18:10,349
You wanna know why?

1777
01:18:10,449 --> 01:18:11,710
Yeah, I do.

1778
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:14,030
I'm sorry.
Forgive me for laughing.

1779
01:18:14,130 --> 01:18:15,130
Why?

1780
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:19,869
I'm more powerful than you
because I'm a bigger sinner.

1781
01:18:19,969 --> 01:18:24,229
Because you're a fallen angel,
and I never believed in God...

1782
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:25,489
or heaven or any of that stuff.

1783
01:18:25,589 --> 01:18:30,029
I'm strictly quarks
and particles and black holes.

1784
01:18:30,129 --> 01:18:32,189
All the other stuff
is junk to me.

1785
01:18:32,289 --> 01:18:34,949
And also I do terrible things.

1786
01:18:35,049 --> 01:18:38,030
I've cheated on all my wives,
and none of 'em deserved it.

1787
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:41,470
I sleep with whores,
I drink too much...

1788
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:43,729
I take pills and I lie
and I'm vain...

1789
01:18:43,829 --> 01:18:47,549
I'm cowardly
and prone to violence.

1790
01:18:47,649 --> 01:18:48,669
Violence?

1791
01:18:48,769 --> 01:18:51,669
I once almost ran over
a book critic with my car...

1792
01:18:51,769 --> 01:18:53,429
but swerved at the last second.

1793
01:18:53,529 --> 01:18:55,149
Did you ever have
two women at once?

1794
01:18:55,249 --> 01:18:57,269
Yes, I did have
two women at once.

1795
01:18:57,369 --> 01:18:58,449
And I'll tell you
something else.

1796
01:18:58,549 --> 01:19:00,110
I didn't care
that it was exploitive.

1797
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:01,350
And I'll tell you
something else.

1798
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:03,150
- They were sisters.
- Really?

1799
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:05,789
Yes. Absolutely.
Two blond WASP sisters.

1800
01:19:05,889 --> 01:19:07,069
Not the Sherman twins?

1801
01:19:07,169 --> 01:19:09,100
Yes, the Sherman twins.
Exactly.

1802
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:11,305
They're here.

1803
01:19:11,405 --> 01:19:13,869
- The Sherman twins are here?
- Sure.

1804
01:19:13,969 --> 01:19:16,430
So, do you know Sandra Pepkin?

1805
01:19:16,530 --> 01:19:18,429
Only the best blow job
in the hadasa.

1806
01:19:18,529 --> 01:19:20,589
So if you know Sandra Pepkin...

1807
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:23,789
I fucked her best friend,
the cripple, Pearl.

1808
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:25,339
Oh, Pearl in the wheelchair.

1809
01:19:26,579 --> 01:19:28,469
Speaking of handicaps,
do you know Marie Taylor?

1810
01:19:28,569 --> 01:19:30,909
Well, yes,
but Marie Taylor I don't count.

1811
01:19:31,009 --> 01:19:32,149
Marie Taylor's dyslexic.

1812
01:19:32,249 --> 01:19:34,509
She put her tampax
in her nose.

1813
01:19:34,609 --> 01:19:35,630
You ever fuck a blind girl?

1814
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:37,309
No, that I never did. Did you?

1815
01:19:37,409 --> 01:19:39,219
They're so grateful.

1816
01:19:40,419 --> 01:19:41,789
Would you like a drink?

1817
01:19:41,889 --> 01:19:44,229
Could I get some tequila?

1818
01:19:44,329 --> 01:19:45,589
I got great tequila.

1819
01:19:45,689 --> 01:19:47,349
Sit down.
Make yourself at home.

1820
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:48,969
You want me to turn on
the air conditioner?

1821
01:19:49,069 --> 01:19:50,069
You're air conditioned here?

1822
01:19:50,169 --> 01:19:52,189
Sure.
It fucks up the ozone layer.

1823
01:19:52,289 --> 01:19:54,710
I could be very comfortable
down here.

1824
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:56,050
I'll tell you something, Harry.

1825
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:57,669
I love it. I love it here.

1826
01:19:57,769 --> 01:19:59,029
I wouldn't be anyplace else.

1827
01:19:59,129 --> 01:20:00,269
Here you go.

1828
01:20:00,369 --> 01:20:03,029
You know, I've been offered
a lot of jobs in your world...

1829
01:20:03,129 --> 01:20:05,069
but why should I be an employee?

1830
01:20:05,169 --> 01:20:07,249
Here I'm my own boss,
and I'm free.

1831
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:08,729
What kind of jobs
did they offer you?

1832
01:20:08,829 --> 01:20:10,430
For two years,
I ran a Hollywood studio...

1833
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:12,589
but you can't trust
those people.

1834
01:20:12,689 --> 01:20:13,709
I agree with you.

1835
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:16,390
Better to rule down here
than to serve in heaven.

1836
01:20:16,490 --> 01:20:17,789
That's Milton, I think.

1837
01:20:17,889 --> 01:20:19,749
To evil.
It keeps things humming.

1838
01:20:19,849 --> 01:20:22,789
Oh, jeez. So you kidnapped Fay?

1839
01:20:22,889 --> 01:20:23,879
Yes, I did.

1840
01:20:23,979 --> 01:20:25,469
But some women are turned on...

1841
01:20:25,569 --> 01:20:26,869
by aggressive, assertive
behavior.

1842
01:20:26,969 --> 01:20:28,990
Yeah, so if I suddenly
kidnapped her back?

1843
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:31,549
You kidnap?
It's not your style.

1844
01:20:31,649 --> 01:20:33,509
You're not a fun guy.
Too serious.

1845
01:20:33,609 --> 01:20:35,669
Fay knew that.
You're too angry at life.

1846
01:20:35,769 --> 01:20:38,269
- I got a lot to be angry at.
- Who doesn't?

1847
01:20:38,369 --> 01:20:41,009
But sooner or later, Harry,
you gotta back off.

1848
01:20:41,109 --> 01:20:43,629
It's like Vegas.
You're up, you're down...

1849
01:20:43,729 --> 01:20:46,349
but in the end,
the house always wins.

1850
01:20:46,449 --> 01:20:48,389
Doesn't mean
you didn't have fun.

1851
01:20:48,489 --> 01:20:51,260
Now, one thing you are not
is a kidnapper.

1852
01:20:51,489 --> 01:20:52,990
Kidnapper!

1853
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:54,503
Listen to me!

1854
01:20:54,886 --> 01:20:56,509
Get out of my way!

1855
01:20:56,609 --> 01:20:59,030
Can't you see you're walking
with a fucking kidnapper?

1856
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:00,539
You'll have to come
with me, sir.

1857
01:21:02,179 --> 01:21:06,870
You're under arrest.
I gotta put the cuffs on you.

1858
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:08,549
You stay over there.

1859
01:21:08,649 --> 01:21:10,060
How can I kidnap my own son?

1860
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:14,390
Hey, we got drugs in the bag.

1861
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:16,380
Let me go, bitch!
Just let me go!

1862
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:19,380
Get off of me, bitch!

1863
01:21:22,179 --> 01:21:23,990
Can't I be honored
and then arrested?

1864
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:25,779
No, we can't do that.
I'm sorry.

1865
01:21:26,979 --> 01:21:28,209
Kidnapping?

1866
01:21:28,309 --> 01:21:32,230
Prostitute in your car
in possession of marijuana.

1867
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:34,749
Possession
of an unlicensed firearm.

1868
01:21:34,849 --> 01:21:36,709
I told you already
about the firearm.

1869
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:39,230
There was a crazy woman
on my roof shooting at me.

1870
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:41,170
I got the gun away from her,
I put it in my car.

1871
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:42,829
I was gonna hand it in.

1872
01:21:42,929 --> 01:21:44,389
I gotta make another phone call.

1873
01:21:44,489 --> 01:21:45,479
You made your call.

1874
01:21:45,579 --> 01:21:46,889
Yeah, I know,
but that didn't count.

1875
01:21:46,989 --> 01:21:48,989
That was to my girlfriend's
answering service.

1876
01:21:49,089 --> 01:21:50,690
I'm trying to keep her
from getting married.

1877
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:52,309
You also called your sister.

1878
01:21:52,409 --> 01:21:53,949
My sister wasn't in.

1879
01:21:54,049 --> 01:21:55,069
You called your lawyer.

1880
01:21:55,169 --> 01:21:56,749
My lawyer was at Canyon Ranch.

1881
01:21:56,849 --> 01:21:58,189
I can never get my lawyer.

1882
01:21:58,289 --> 01:22:00,389
Can I give you some advice?

1883
01:22:00,489 --> 01:22:02,659
You're in deep shit.

1884
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:12,500
This time,
I think you've really had it.

1885
01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:17,469
Hey, it was your idea
to kidnap Hilly.

1886
01:22:17,569 --> 01:22:18,949
It was my idea?
It wasn't my idea.

1887
01:22:19,049 --> 01:22:20,269
I made a joke.

1888
01:22:20,369 --> 01:22:22,389
You don't have to act out
on every impulse.

1889
01:22:22,489 --> 01:22:24,070
You've got to tell me
the truth.

1890
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:26,109
Is it better being dead?

1891
01:22:26,209 --> 01:22:28,709
No, it's not really,
but there's one good thing.

1892
01:22:28,809 --> 01:22:30,609
You don't get called
for jury duty...

1893
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:32,229
but then you have no options.

1894
01:22:32,329 --> 01:22:33,629
It's not for you.

1895
01:22:33,729 --> 01:22:35,629
Jesus. I'm no good at life.

1896
01:22:35,729 --> 01:22:37,790
No, but you write well.

1897
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:39,610
I write well,
but that's a different story...

1898
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:41,790
because I can manipulate
the characters and plots.

1899
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:43,309
You create your own universe...

1900
01:22:43,409 --> 01:22:45,549
but that's much nicer
than the world we have.

1901
01:22:45,649 --> 01:22:47,789
But I can't function
in the world we have.

1902
01:22:47,889 --> 01:22:50,130
I'm a failure at life.

1903
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:53,109
I think you bring pleasure
to a lot of people.

1904
01:22:53,209 --> 01:22:55,070
But even that's drying up.

1905
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:57,069
For the last months...

1906
01:22:57,169 --> 01:23:01,189
I haven't been able to come up
with a meaningful idea to write.

1907
01:23:01,289 --> 01:23:05,669
Make peace with your demons
and your block will pass.

1908
01:23:05,769 --> 01:23:10,100
Jesus, it sounds so trite,
but I just want to be happy.

1909
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,429
To be alive is to be happy.

1910
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:13,979
Take it from me.

1911
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:17,380
Hey, Block. Come on.

1912
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:22,739
Some people
just put up your bail.

1913
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:25,700
This way.

1914
01:23:26,499 --> 01:23:27,789
You?

1915
01:23:27,889 --> 01:23:30,070
We got the message
on our service.

1916
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:31,469
Came right from our wedding.

1917
01:23:31,569 --> 01:23:33,429
You did?

1918
01:23:33,529 --> 01:23:34,909
We're on our way
to our honeymoon.

1919
01:23:35,009 --> 01:23:37,989
- You got married?
- You have to ask?

1920
01:23:38,089 --> 01:23:39,410
I can't believe it.

1921
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:41,789
In the end,
you chose him over me?

1922
01:23:41,889 --> 01:23:43,069
I can't fathom this.

1923
01:23:43,169 --> 01:23:44,990
You're gonna insult me
after we ran from the altar...

1924
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:46,150
to keep you from rotting
in prison?

1925
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:47,949
I know you get claustrophobic.

1926
01:23:48,049 --> 01:23:49,629
Plus you're the perfect punk.

1927
01:23:49,729 --> 01:23:51,670
You'll get buggered
by every con in the cell block.

1928
01:23:51,770 --> 01:23:53,910
You're the guy
that should be in there...

1929
01:23:54,010 --> 01:23:55,789
because you stole her
from under my nose.

1930
01:23:55,889 --> 01:23:59,309
Harry, he did not steal me.
I love him.

1931
01:23:59,409 --> 01:24:01,269
I can't fathom this.

1932
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:04,029
I appreciate your coming,
but I can't...

1933
01:24:04,129 --> 01:24:06,349
Why? Why not me?

1934
01:24:06,449 --> 01:24:09,229
You told me I wasn't supposed
to fall in love with you.

1935
01:24:09,329 --> 01:24:12,369
How could you listen to me?
You know how crazy I am.

1936
01:24:12,469 --> 01:24:15,069
Well, you were my mentor,
that's why.

1937
01:24:15,169 --> 01:24:16,749
But you were sleeping
with your mentor.

1938
01:24:16,849 --> 01:24:19,789
So? I've slept
with my gynecologist.

1939
01:24:19,889 --> 01:24:22,549
What has that got to do
with anything?

1940
01:24:22,649 --> 01:24:24,669
You're gonna snorkel
down the Amazon with him...

1941
01:24:24,769 --> 01:24:26,789
when you could have me?

1942
01:24:26,889 --> 01:24:29,310
I will never be
the writer you are.

1943
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:30,909
You put your art into your work.

1944
01:24:31,009 --> 01:24:32,429
I put it into my life.

1945
01:24:32,529 --> 01:24:34,149
I can make her happier.

1946
01:24:34,249 --> 01:24:36,189
I love you.

1947
01:24:36,289 --> 01:24:40,509
I do. It's just that
I'm in love with Larry.

1948
01:24:40,609 --> 01:24:42,289
I'm his wife.

1949
01:24:42,389 --> 01:24:44,989
I love you, too, Harry.
Give us your blessing...

1950
01:24:45,089 --> 01:24:47,550
so that we can go and enjoy
our honeymoon.

1951
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:49,010
We'll be in Santa Fe
about a month...

1952
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:52,350
and when we come back, we'll
all go out. We're friends.

1953
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:53,830
This is where you're going
on your honeymoon?

1954
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:55,589
He's taking you to the desert?

1955
01:24:55,689 --> 01:24:58,549
Sand? The desert is cactus.

1956
01:24:58,649 --> 01:25:00,369
It's gila monsters...

1957
01:25:00,469 --> 01:25:03,789
whatever you call them,
lizards, is the desert.

1958
01:25:03,889 --> 01:25:06,029
Harry, give us your blessing,
please?

1959
01:25:06,129 --> 01:25:07,549
Give 'em your blessings...

1960
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:09,829
before I throw you back
in that fucking jail cell...

1961
01:25:09,929 --> 01:25:11,099
and I bugger you.

1962
01:25:14,139 --> 01:25:16,549
I don't know what to say.
I love you.

1963
01:25:16,649 --> 01:25:18,740
This guy I've loved...

1964
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:23,179
I give up. I give up.

1965
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:27,299
We'll get you home, all right?

1966
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:30,429
Santa Fe, you're gonna take her?

1967
01:25:30,529 --> 01:25:31,900
Tacos.

1968
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:56,180
Harry, what about
the honoring ceremony?

1969
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:00,790
We haven't had the ceremony.

1970
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:02,660
The police interrupted.

1971
01:26:04,339 --> 01:26:05,949
What, am I dreaming?

1972
01:26:06,049 --> 01:26:07,069
Everybody dreams.

1973
01:26:07,169 --> 01:26:08,549
Come on.

1974
01:26:08,649 --> 01:26:10,420
Professor Clark
has everything planned.

1975
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:14,629
Can I bring Hilly?

1976
01:26:14,729 --> 01:26:16,900
Well, it's your dream.

1977
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:19,709
Stebbins Hall?

1978
01:26:19,809 --> 01:26:22,269
Everyone is waiting
to honor you.

1979
01:26:22,369 --> 01:26:25,339
After all, you created them.

1980
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:31,389
I love all of you.

1981
01:27:31,489 --> 01:27:32,909
Really, you've given me...

1982
01:27:33,009 --> 01:27:35,229
some of the happiest moments
of my life...

1983
01:27:35,329 --> 01:27:38,749
and you've even
saved my life at times.

1984
01:27:38,849 --> 01:27:41,789
And now you've actually
taught me things...

1985
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:43,189
and I'm completely grateful...

1986
01:27:43,289 --> 01:27:46,109
I think the author's message
is to know yourself...

1987
01:27:46,209 --> 01:27:48,669
stop kidding yourself,
accept your limitations...

1988
01:27:48,769 --> 01:27:50,130
and get on with your life.

1989
01:27:50,230 --> 01:27:51,269
It's amazing.

1990
01:27:51,369 --> 01:27:54,589
To me, it's a really interesting
character...

1991
01:27:54,689 --> 01:27:57,989
a guy who can't function well
in life...

1992
01:27:58,089 --> 01:28:01,469
but can only function in art.

1993
01:28:01,569 --> 01:28:04,670
It's sort of sad in a way
and also funny.

1994
01:28:04,770 --> 01:28:07,589
But your books all seem
a little sad on the surface...

1995
01:28:07,689 --> 01:28:09,170
which is why I like
deconstructing them...

1996
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:11,349
because underneath
they're really happy.

1997
01:28:11,449 --> 01:28:12,740
It's just that
you don't know it.

1998
01:28:14,819 --> 01:28:16,829
I feel like I'm in a dream.

1999
01:28:16,929 --> 01:28:20,589
This, for me, is the best dream
I've had in months.

2000
01:28:20,689 --> 01:28:22,896
The happiest dream.

2001
01:28:23,023 --> 01:28:24,749
Oh, I like it.

2002
01:28:24,849 --> 01:28:26,429
I like it.

2003
01:28:26,529 --> 01:28:31,570
A character who's too neurotic
to function in life...

2004
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:34,819
who can only function in art.

2005
01:28:36,938 --> 01:28:38,219
<i>Notes for a novel.</i>
