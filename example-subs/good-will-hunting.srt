1
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,779
Mod f x square dx.

2
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:43,704
So please finish Percival
by next time.

3
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:47,746
I know many of you had this as
undergraduates, but it won't hurt to brush up.

4
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,707
Thank you, Steven.

5
00:03:55,217 --> 00:04:00,009
I also put an advanced Fourier system
on the main hallway chalkboard.

6
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:02,807
And I'm hoping that one of you might
prove it by the end of the semester.

7
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:05,683
Now, the person to do so
will not only be in my good graces...

8
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,059
but also go on to fame and fortune...

9
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:11,939
by having their accomplishment
recorded and their name printed...

10
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:14,982
in the auspicious M.I.T. Tech.

11
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:18,976
Former winners include Nobel laureates,
Field's medal winners...

12
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:23,738
renowned astrophysicists
and lowly M.I.T. Professors.

13
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:25,325
Well, that's all.

14
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:29,744
If you have any questions,
I'm sure that Tom has the answers.

15
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,278
- Hi, Will.
- Kirsten, how you doing?

16
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:11,693
- I'm all right. How are you?
- Good.

17
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:14,195
- I didn't get on Cathy last night.
- No?

18
00:05:14,326 --> 00:05:15,606
- No.
- Why not?

19
00:05:15,744 --> 00:05:18,661
- I don't know. Cathy!
- What?

20
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:22,156
Why didn't you give me none of that nasty
little hoochie-woochie you usually throw at me?

21
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:26,039
Oh, fuck you and your Irish curse,
Chuckie.

22
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:30,036
Like I'd waste my energy spreadin'
my legs for that Tootsie Roll dick?

23
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:33,505
- So go home and give it a tug yourself.
- Tootsie Roll!

24
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,543
Toot-Toots!

25
00:05:35,677 --> 00:05:38,761
She's missin' a tooth, Will.

26
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:41,889
She's got skin problems.
I don't...

27
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:44,637
Plus, it's like 5-to-2, Morgan ends
up marryin' her, you know what I mean?

28
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:47,804
There's only so many times you can bang
your friend's future wife.

29
00:05:47,937 --> 00:05:50,393
It's wrong.
Where you goin'?

30
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:54,983
- I'm gonna take off.
- Fuck you, you're takin' off. It's like, what, 10:00?

31
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,316
I'm tired.

32
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:01,482
Irish curse?

33
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:04,486
She don't know.
There ain't no Irish curse.

34
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:14,758
- Out!
- Stop brushing me back.

35
00:07:14,886 --> 00:07:19,049
Stop crowding the plate!
Which one will it be?

36
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,301
You're gonna get charged,
you know that.

37
00:07:23,435 --> 00:07:27,183
You think I'm afraid of you, you big
fuck? You're crowdin' the fuckin' plate.

38
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:31,939
Hey, uh, Casey's bouncin' up a bar, uh, at
Harvard next week. We should go up there.

39
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:34,143
- What are we gonna do up there?
- I don't know.

40
00:07:34,277 --> 00:07:38,274
We'll fuck up some smart kids.
You'll probably fit right in.

41
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,820
Ow! Fuckin' punk!

42
00:07:43,702 --> 00:07:45,659
- Oh, what's up? You still tough?
- Come on!

43
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:49,117
- You want this?
- Ah, come on, come on. That's it.

44
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:55,910
I'd hold you forever here

45
00:07:56,045 --> 00:07:59,628
In my arms

46
00:07:59,757 --> 00:08:01,334
- Professor Lambeau?
- Yes?

47
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:05,298
I'm in your applied theories class. We're
all up at the math and science building.

48
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:09,212
Come here. It's Saturday!

49
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:11,839
Unless you want to have a drink
with me tonight.

50
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:14,976
Maybe. We just couldn't wait
until Monday to find out.

51
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,768
- Find out what?
- Who proved the theorem.

52
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:44,616
This is correct.
Who did this?

53
00:08:44,753 --> 00:08:46,959
- Jack?
- It wasn't me.

54
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,713
- Nemesh?
- No way.

55
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:56,549
- Come on, Joey Mac!
- Billy, McNamara's up.

56
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,052
Come on, kid!

57
00:08:59,182 --> 00:09:01,424
- Joey, dig it out of there. Dig it out!
- I love the pitch!

58
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:04,974
Lay it down, Mac. That's how to do it!
Attaboy! Take two, Mac, take two!

59
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:08,685
- Nice hit.
- Taylor, you're up.

60
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:12,515
Hey, Morgan, who's the girl with
the striped pants? She's got a nice ass.

61
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,569
- Yeah, that's a real nice ass.
- Who's the guy she's with?

62
00:09:15,696 --> 00:09:19,147
It's that fuckin' guinea. I hate
that little bitch. Will knows him.

63
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:21,654
- You know him?
- Yeah, fuckin' Carmine Scarpaglia.

64
00:09:21,784 --> 00:09:23,777
That kid used to beat the shit out of me
in kindergarten.

65
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:25,654
- That guy?
- Yeah.

66
00:09:27,664 --> 00:09:29,704
Fuck this.
Let's get some food.

67
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,956
Oh, what, Morgan,
you're not gonna go talk to her?

68
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:33,413
Fuck her.

69
00:09:33,544 --> 00:09:36,165
- I could go for a Whopper.
- Let's go to Kelly's.

70
00:09:36,297 --> 00:09:39,297
Morgan, I'm not goin' to Kelly's
just 'cause you like the take-out girl.

71
00:09:39,424 --> 00:09:43,836
- It's 15 minutes out of our way.
- What the fuck are we gonna do? We can't spare 15 minutes?

72
00:09:46,597 --> 00:09:47,213
Double burger.

73
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,842
Double burger?

74
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:55,218
Chuck I had a double burger

75
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:58,059
Would you shut the fuck up?
I know what you ordered. I was there.

76
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,191
- So give me my fuckin' sandwich.
- What do you mean, your sandwich? I bought it.

77
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:03,026
Morgan, how much money you got on you?

78
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:07,066
I said I'd get change when I get the snow
cone. I said that before when we pulled up.

79
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:09,404
Why don't you just gimme my sandwich
and stop bein' a prick?

80
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:14,111
All right, well, give me your fuckin' 16 cents that you
got on you now. We'll put your fuckin' sandwich on layaway.

81
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:18,112
Here we go. Keep it right up here
for ya. We'll put you on a programme.

82
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:21,534
Every day you come in with your six cents.
At the end of the week, you get your sandwich.

83
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:25,368
- Are you gonna be an asshole?
- What am I, fuckin' sandwich welfare?

84
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:27,296
I think you should establish
a good line of credit.

85
00:10:27,423 --> 00:10:30,708
Like how you bought your couch:
Payment plans.

86
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:33,594
Remember how your mother brought
in ten dollars every day for a year?

87
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,463
She finally got her couch
Rent-A-Center style.

88
00:10:35,597 --> 00:10:38,882
- Can I have my food now, please?
- Here's your fuckin' double burger.

89
00:10:40,684 --> 00:10:43,056
- Whoa!
- Hey, hold up, Chuck.

90
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:45,475
- Slow it down.
- Who do we got?

91
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:48,178
- I don't know yet.
- Hey, douche bag!

92
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:51,565
- Yeah, you, you skank face!
- Shut the fuck up!

93
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:54,647
- Let's get outta here. - What are
you worried about? - Come on, Will.

94
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,439
Why don't you lick my love stick?

95
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,988
We just seen the guy 15 minutes ago at the park.
If we was gonna fight him, we should fight him then.

96
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,952
- We got snacks now.
- Shut up, Morgan, you're goin'.

97
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:05,236
- I'm not goin'. - So
don't go. - I am not goin'!

98
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:07,779
Fuckin' go, Morgan.

99
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:12,244
Let me tell you somethin'. If you're not out there in
two fuckin' seconds, when I'm done with them, you're next.

100
00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:16,422
Carmine, it's me. It's me, Will.
Remember? We went to kindergarten together.

101
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:20,925
Way down the street
there's a light in his place

102
00:11:21,052 --> 00:11:23,589
He opens the door
He's got that look on his face

103
00:11:30,768 --> 00:11:34,184
- Fuckin', let's go, man!
- Step on his fuckin' head.

104
00:11:34,313 --> 00:11:38,262
Get his ass on the ground.
Stop that motherfucker.

105
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:46,608
Motherfucker, die!

106
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,278
- Carter!
- Come on!

107
00:12:01,336 --> 00:12:04,953
Will! Will, come on! Come on.

108
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:08,461
Will, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

109
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,294
- Easy, brother, easy.
- Hey, fellas, thanks for comin' out.

110
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:15,303
- Come here.
- Whoa, whoa!

111
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:24,139
Fuck!

112
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,738
Ls this just my imagination,
or has my class grown considerably?

113
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:41,279
Well, by no stretch of my imagination do I
believe you've all come here to hear me lecture.

114
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:46,405
Or rather, to ascertain the identity
of the mystery math magician.

115
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:51,332
So without further adieu, come forward,
silent rogue, and receive thy prize.

116
00:13:02,512 --> 00:13:06,095
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint
my spectators, but...

117
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:09,011
it seems there will be
no unmasking here today.

118
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:12,761
However, um, my colleagues and I
have conferred...

119
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:15,932
and there is a problem
on the board right now...

120
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:18,188
that took us more than two years
to prove.

121
00:13:19,068 --> 00:13:22,851
So let this be said:
The gauntlet has been thrown down...

122
00:13:22,988 --> 00:13:27,032
but the faculty have answered
and answered with vigour.

123
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,744
- Hi.
- When's the arraignment?

124
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,752
Next week.

125
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:14,989
- Sorry. - What are
you doing? - Sorry.

126
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:17,487
That's people's work.
You can't graffiti here.

127
00:14:17,617 --> 00:14:20,369
- Don't you walk away from me!
- Hey, fuck you!

128
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:23,448
Oh, you're a clever one.
What's your name?

129
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:47,801
Oh, my God.

130
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:56,606
Looks right.

131
00:15:11,913 --> 00:15:14,949
Will, how retarded do you gotta be
to get fired from that job?

132
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,656
I mean, how hard is it to push
a motherfuckin' broom around the room?

133
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:20,248
Mitch, you got fired from pushin'
a fuckin' broom.

134
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,122
I got fired 'cause management
was restructuring.

135
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,209
Yeah, restructuring the amount
of retards they had workin' for 'em.

136
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,417
Shut up. You get canned
more than tuna, bitch.

137
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,920
- At least I got a motherfuckin' job right now, don't I?
- Yeah.

138
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:35,597
- Why did you get fired, Will? Come on.
- Uh, management was restructuring.

139
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:39,639
- My uncle could probably get you on a demo team.
- Can he do that?

140
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:44,016
- You kiddin' me? I asked you yesterday if I could get a job.
- And I told you "no" yesterday.

141
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:46,686
- What's up, Case? - What's
up, Case? - What's up, Big Case?

142
00:15:49,445 --> 00:15:52,778
Let's sit over here.

143
00:15:59,203 --> 00:16:02,572
Oh, this is,
this is a Harvard bar, huh?

144
00:16:02,706 --> 00:16:05,244
I thought there'd be, like,
equations and shit on the walls.

145
00:16:07,126 --> 00:16:10,993
I will take a pitcher
of the finest lager in the house.

146
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:22,096
Time-out. I'm gonna have to bust a little move
on them Harvard hotties down there at the bar.

147
00:16:22,223 --> 00:16:25,721
- Work some magic.
- Get some potion for us.

148
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,198
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hello.

149
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:46,233
- Hi, how are ya?
- Fine.

150
00:16:46,368 --> 00:16:48,407
- So, do you ladies, uh...
- Come here often?

151
00:16:48,536 --> 00:16:53,530
Do I come here? I come here a bit. I'm
here, uh, uh, you know, from time to time.

152
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,907
- Do you go to school here?
- Yep.

153
00:16:56,043 --> 00:16:59,910
- Yeah. That's it. Yes, I think I had a class with you.
- Oh, yeah?

154
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:02,371
- What class?
- History.

155
00:17:02,507 --> 00:17:05,424
- Maybe.
- Yes, I think that's what it was.

156
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:09,050
You don't necessarily... May not
remember me. You know, I like it here.

157
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,385
It doesn't mean 'cause I go here,
I'm a genius.

158
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:12,794
- I am very smart.
- Hey.

159
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,138
- Hey! How's it goin'? How are ya?
- Good. How ya doin'?

160
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,805
- You wanna...
- What, uh... What class did you, did you say that was?

161
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,810
- History.
- History. Yeah.

162
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:23,437
Just history? Lt must've been
a survey course then, huh?

163
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:25,108
- Yeah, it was. It was surveys.
- Right.

164
00:17:25,234 --> 00:17:27,903
You should check it out. It's
a good course. It'd be a good class.

165
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:29,487
How'd you like that course?

166
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:34,488
You know, frankly, I found the class,
you know, rather, uh, elementary.

167
00:17:34,617 --> 00:17:36,693
Elementary. You know,
I don't doubt that it was.

168
00:17:36,827 --> 00:17:40,077
- Yeah.
- I, uh, I remember that class.

169
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:43,953
It was, um, it was
just between recess and lunch.

170
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,574
Clark, why don't you go away?

171
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,786
- Why don't you relax?
- Why don't you go just away?

172
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:50,794
I'm just having fun with my new friend.
That's all.

173
00:17:50,922 --> 00:17:53,876
- What, we gonna have a problem?
- No, no, no, no, no. There's no problem here.

174
00:17:54,008 --> 00:17:57,922
I was just hoping you might give me
some insight into the evolution...

175
00:17:58,053 --> 00:18:01,303
of the market economy
in the southern colonies.

176
00:18:01,431 --> 00:18:05,215
My contention is that, uh,
prior to the Revolutionary War...

177
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:09,598
the economic modalities,
especially in the southern colonies...

178
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,351
could most aptly be characterized as...

179
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:14,273
- agrarian precapitalist.
- Let me tell you something. All right?

180
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:16,642
Of course that's your contention.
You're a first-year grad student.

181
00:18:16,778 --> 00:18:19,944
You just got finished readin' some
Marxian historian, Pete Garrison, probably.

182
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:22,942
You're gonna be convinced of that till
next month when you get to James Lemon.

183
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:26,324
Then you're gonna be talkin' about how the
economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania...

184
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:29,239
were entrepreneurial and capitalist
way back in 1740.

185
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:32,870
That's gonna last until next year. You're
gonna be in here regurgitatin' Gordon Wood...

186
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
talkin' about, you know,
the prerevolutionary utopia...

187
00:18:36,127 --> 00:18:40,420
and the capital-forming effects
of military mobilization.

188
00:18:40,548 --> 00:18:44,545
Well, as a matter of fact, I won't, because
Wood drastically underestimates the impact of...

189
00:18:44,676 --> 00:18:48,376
"Wood drastically, Wood drastically
underestimates the impact of social distinctions...

190
00:18:48,513 --> 00:18:51,549
predicated upon wealth,
especially inherited wealth"?

191
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:55,845
You got that from Vickers'
Work in Essex County. Page 98, right?

192
00:18:55,977 --> 00:18:58,468
Yeah, I read that, too. Were you gonna
plagiarize the whole thing for us?

193
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:02,269
Do you have any thoughts, uh,
of your own on this matter?

194
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:03,977
Or do you... Is that your thing?
You come into a bar.

195
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:08,569
You read some obscure passage and then
pretend... You, You pawn it off as your own...

196
00:19:08,696 --> 00:19:13,441
As your own idea just to impress
some girls? Embarrass my friend?

197
00:19:13,575 --> 00:19:17,193
See, the sad thing about a guy like you is, in 50 years
you're gonna start doin' some thinkin' on your own.

198
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:19,700
And you're gonna come up with the fact
that there are two certainties in life.

199
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:22,500
One: Don't do that.

200
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,376
And two: You dropped 150 grand
on a fuckin' education...

201
00:19:25,502 --> 00:19:28,668
you could've got for $1.50
in late charges at the public library.

202
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:33,295
Yeah, but I will have a degree...

203
00:19:33,426 --> 00:19:37,339
and you'll be servin' my kids fries at a
drive through on our way to a skiing trip.

204
00:19:38,972 --> 00:19:41,889
Yeah, maybe. Yeah, but at least
I won't be unoriginal.

205
00:19:43,184 --> 00:19:46,599
But I mean, if you have a problem with that, I mean,
we could just step outside. We could figure it out.

206
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:51,976
No, man, there's no problem.
It's cool.

207
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,349
- It's cool?
- Yeah. - Cool.

208
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,892
- Fuckin' damn right, it's cool.
- How do you like me now?

209
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,272
My boy's wicked smart.

210
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:07,697
I just spent three minutes in this
fuckin' place, and run into a barney, huh?

211
00:20:08,997 --> 00:20:11,618
Well, there it is.
Hello, nice to meet ya.

212
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,703
They were fine, man. I was gonna...
We was gonna close the deal...

213
00:20:14,835 --> 00:20:18,121
but then Chuck, uh,
Billy insulted one of 'em...

214
00:20:18,255 --> 00:20:21,837
and the heavyset girl said that I even had a
receding hairline, and I was a few pounds overweight.

215
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:24,208
And I was like, "Go fuck yourself. "

216
00:20:25,595 --> 00:20:27,717
I swallowed a bug.

217
00:20:29,014 --> 00:20:30,389
Hi.

218
00:20:30,515 --> 00:20:33,220
- You're an idiot.
- What?

219
00:20:33,351 --> 00:20:37,728
You're an idiot. I've been sitting over there for
45 minutes waiting for you to come and talk to me.

220
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:40,096
But I'm tired now,
and I have to go home.

221
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:42,901
And I, I couldn't sit there any more
waiting for you.

222
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:44,983
- Wh... I'm Will.
- Skylar.

223
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,735
- Skylar.
- Oh, and by the way...

224
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:50,313
that guy over there,
Michael Bolton clone...

225
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,406
he wasn't sitting with us,
so to speak.

226
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:54,407
Yeah, I know.
I kinda got that impression.

227
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:57,702
Good. Okay.
Well, I've got to go.

228
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,779
Gotta get up early and waste some
more money on my overpriced education.

229
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:04,454
- No, I didn't mean you. I...
- Ah, that's all right.

230
00:21:04,586 --> 00:21:07,871
There's my number. So maybe we can
go out for coffee sometime.

231
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:12,049
All right, yeah. May-Maybe we can just
get together and eat a bunch of caramels.

232
00:21:12,176 --> 00:21:15,923
- What do you mean?
- When you think about it, it's as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.

233
00:21:16,054 --> 00:21:18,675
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

234
00:21:18,806 --> 00:21:21,807
- Uh, right, then.
- Come on.

235
00:21:28,898 --> 00:21:31,733
- Yo! - Fuck you, bitch!
- Hey, fuck you the same.

236
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:35,441
- There goes them fuckin' barneys right now with their skiin' trip.
- Hold up. Hold up.

237
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,736
I should've beat that old bitch's ass.

238
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,279
Do you like apples?

239
00:21:48,706 --> 00:21:50,782
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

240
00:21:52,376 --> 00:21:55,709
Well, I got her number!
How do you like them apples?

241
00:21:59,924 --> 00:22:04,799
We arrived tonight

242
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:09,636
The miles were over me

243
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:16,509
I turned off the light

244
00:22:17,606 --> 00:22:21,519
So, come on, night

245
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,612
Everyone is gone

246
00:22:31,201 --> 00:22:34,403
Home to oblivion

247
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:41,665
So come on

248
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:46,004
So come on by

249
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,713
Tom.

250
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:57,837
Excuse me. Is this the Buildings
and Grounds office?

251
00:22:57,973 --> 00:23:00,179
Yeah. What can I do for you?

252
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:02,265
I just need the name of a student
who works here.

253
00:23:02,394 --> 00:23:04,765
- No students work for me.
- Well, could you please check?

254
00:23:04,896 --> 00:23:07,018
I have this guy who works
in my building. He's about this high.

255
00:23:07,148 --> 00:23:09,816
- Which one is your building?
- Two.

256
00:23:09,942 --> 00:23:12,100
Two. Building two.

257
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:20,690
- Look, if anything was stolen, I should know about it.
- No, no, no. It's nothing like that.

258
00:23:20,826 --> 00:23:22,735
I just need his name.

259
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:25,739
I can't give you his name
unless you have a complaint.

260
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:29,038
- This is Professor Lambeau.
- And this is Professor Hayes.

261
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,739
Tom, please.

262
00:23:33,753 --> 00:23:37,003
This is important. Please.

263
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:41,045
Willy didn't show up for work today.

264
00:23:41,176 --> 00:23:43,252
Got this job through his P.O.
You can call him.

265
00:23:43,386 --> 00:23:47,384
- P.O.?
- Yeah. Parole officer.

266
00:23:51,268 --> 00:23:53,142
Thank you.

267
00:23:54,437 --> 00:23:56,311
Asshole.

268
00:23:58,691 --> 00:24:03,732
There is a lengthy legal precedent,
Your Honour, going back to 1789...

269
00:24:03,862 --> 00:24:07,112
whereby a defendant can claim self-defense
against an agent of the government...

270
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,533
if that act is deemed a defence against
tyranny, a defence of liberty.

271
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,989
Your Honour, Henry Ward Beecher, in Proverbs from
the Plymouth Pulpit, 1887, said, and I quote...

272
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,494
- 1887? This is the 20th century, Your Honour.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

273
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,368
- He's gonna make a mockery of the courtroom.
- I am afforded the right...

274
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:24,545
to speak in my own defence, sir, by
the Constitution of the United States.

275
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,506
- This is the same document which guarantees my liberty.
- Don't tell me about the Constitution of the United States.

276
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,087
And liberty, in case you've forgotten,
is a souI's right to breathe.

277
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,673
And when it cannot take a long breath,
laws are girded too tight.

278
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:35,091
- Without liberty, man is a syncope.
- Man is a what?

279
00:24:35,222 --> 00:24:38,306
- Ibid., Your Honour.
- Son, my turn.

280
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:43,094
I've been sitting here for ten minutes
now lookin' over this rap sheet of yours.

281
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:47,095
I just can't believe it.
June '93, assault.

282
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:49,308
September '93, assault.

283
00:24:49,442 --> 00:24:52,941
Grand theft auto, February of '94.

284
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:57,281
Where, apparently, you defended yourself
and had the case thrown out by citing...

285
00:24:57,407 --> 00:25:01,736
"free property rights of horse
and carriage" from 1798.

286
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:05,202
Joke. January '95,
impersonating an officer.

287
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:09,280
Mayhem, theft, resisting.
All overturned.

288
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:13,000
I'm also aware that you've
been through several foster homes.

289
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:17,292
The state removed you from three
because of serious physical abuse.

290
00:25:17,424 --> 00:25:21,552
You know, another judge might care,
but you hit a cop. You're going in.

291
00:25:21,678 --> 00:25:25,971
Motion to dismiss is denied.
$50,000 bail.

292
00:25:26,098 --> 00:25:28,636
- Thank you.
- Court, rise.

293
00:25:31,144 --> 00:25:33,302
- Hello?
- Uh, Skylar?

294
00:25:33,438 --> 00:25:35,596
- Yep.
- Hey, uh, it's Will.

295
00:25:35,731 --> 00:25:37,309
- Who?
- It's Will.

296
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:40,477
You know, the really funny, good-looking
guy you met at the bar the other night.

297
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:44,145
I don't recall meeting anyone who matched
that description. I think I'd remember.

298
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,446
Oh, all right, you got me. It's
the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser...

299
00:25:47,575 --> 00:25:49,697
who got hammered
and wouldn't leave you alone all night.

300
00:25:49,826 --> 00:25:53,870
Oh, Will! I remember.

301
00:25:53,997 --> 00:25:57,246
- How are you? I-I was wondering
if you'd call me. - Yeah, look.

302
00:25:57,374 --> 00:25:59,082
- I was wondering...
- Yo, so, baby. What's up?

303
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:00,869
- Hold on one second.
- What you doing?

304
00:26:01,003 --> 00:26:03,410
- Hey!
- What's up, baby? Want some of my ass?

305
00:26:03,546 --> 00:26:07,164
- Herve! I remember you from juvi. How you doing?
- What's up, baby? What you doing?

306
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,506
Ah, yeah, sorry about that. Um...

307
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:12,339
I was wonderin' maybe we could
get together, um, sometime this week.

308
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:14,795
You know, sit out at a cafe.
Maybe have some caramels.

309
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:17,219
- Oh, that sounds wonderful.
- Yeah?

310
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,223
Yeah. Sure. Where are you?

311
00:26:19,351 --> 00:26:22,138
Um, well, actually, this is, uh,
this is just a shot in the dark...

312
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:26,599
but, uh, there's no chance that you're,
uh, pre-law, is there?

313
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:33,855
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

314
00:26:33,989 --> 00:26:35,898
Nice talking to ya.

315
00:26:38,326 --> 00:26:40,484
What the fuck do you want?

316
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:42,244
I'm Gerald Lambeau.

317
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:46,029
The professor you told
to fuck himself.

318
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:50,541
Well, what the fuck do you want?

319
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:54,749
I've spoken to the judge, and he's agreed
to release you under my supervision.

320
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,915
- Really?
- Yeah.

321
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:05,045
- But under two conditions.
- What are those?

322
00:27:05,182 --> 00:27:07,672
First condition is that
you meet with me every week.

323
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:11,343
- What for?
- Go over the proof you're working on...

324
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:16,056
get into some, some more advanced...

325
00:27:16,191 --> 00:27:19,227
combinatorial mathematics...

326
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,234
finite math.

327
00:27:23,364 --> 00:27:25,237
Sounds like a real hoot.

328
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:31,320
And the second condition is that,
that you see a therapist.

329
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:39,493
And I'm responsible to submit reports
on those meetings.

330
00:27:39,627 --> 00:27:42,628
And if you fail to meet with any
of those conditions...

331
00:27:42,755 --> 00:27:44,628
you will have to serve time.

332
00:27:44,757 --> 00:27:49,133
All right. I'll do the math, but I'm not
gonna meet with any fuckin' therapist.

333
00:27:49,261 --> 00:27:53,092
It's better than spending that time
in jail, isn't it?

334
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:00,939
I read your book, and, uh, and, and
"Mike" was havin' the same problems...

335
00:29:01,071 --> 00:29:03,360
that "Chad," the stockbroker,
was havin'.

336
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,443
Absolutely right. Right on the button.
Good for you, Will. Very nice.

337
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:08,153
Thank you.

338
00:29:08,286 --> 00:29:11,488
Will, the pressures,
and I'm not judging them...

339
00:29:11,622 --> 00:29:14,291
I'm not, uh, labelling them...

340
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:17,369
but they are destroying
your potential.

341
00:29:17,502 --> 00:29:22,495
Now no more shenanigans.
No more tomfoolery. No more ballyhoo.

342
00:29:22,631 --> 00:29:25,418
You're right.

343
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,424
God, I know.

344
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:31,340
You know, you're not gonna get off
that easily. Come on, Will, a bit more.

345
00:29:31,472 --> 00:29:33,179
Well, I mean, I do, I do do things,
you know? I mean...

346
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:35,762
What, uh, what kind of things?

347
00:29:35,892 --> 00:29:39,095
I do things that, you know, I, uh... You
know, I mean, I hide from, from people.

348
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:44,020
- You hide, do you?
- No, no. I mean, I like... I, I go places. I interact, you know.

349
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,687
- Really? What sort of places?
- Just certain clubs.

350
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,857
More. That's nice, yes.
What sort of clubs?

351
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,987
- Like, um, like Fantasy.
- Fantasy?

352
00:29:52,114 --> 00:29:53,988
- It's not bad.
- Bit more.

353
00:29:54,116 --> 00:29:58,528
It's just something like when you get
in there and, the music like owns you.

354
00:29:58,661 --> 00:30:01,199
It's like that house music.
It's like...

355
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:09,035
- You know, you start dancin'. It's just...
- Boom, boom, boom. Yes.

356
00:30:10,129 --> 00:30:13,046
- Yes.
- Yeah.

357
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:16,963
Do you find it hard to hide the fact
that you're gay?

358
00:30:17,094 --> 00:30:20,047
What are you... What are you...
What are you talking about? What?

359
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,717
Look, buddy, two seconds ago,
you were ready to give me a jump.

360
00:30:22,848 --> 00:30:26,051
A jump? Are you...

361
00:30:26,185 --> 00:30:28,343
I'm terribly sorry to disappoint you.
But...

362
00:30:28,478 --> 00:30:31,183
I don't have a problem with it.
I don't care if you putt from the rough.

363
00:30:31,314 --> 00:30:35,097
What are you... P-Putting from the rough?
What on earth are you talking about?

364
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:40,440
A difficult theorem
can be like a symphony.

365
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,611
It's very erotic.

366
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,409
You go somewhere else.
I can't handle this.

367
00:30:45,534 --> 00:30:48,737
- Wow.
- Thank you, Henry.

368
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,329
Ah, Henry.

369
00:30:50,455 --> 00:30:53,740
Hi, Gerry. Hey, you know something?
I can't do this pro bono work any more.

370
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:55,748
It's just not... It's not worth it.

371
00:30:55,876 --> 00:30:58,449
- What happened?
- Well, I'm going on national television next week.

372
00:30:58,587 --> 00:31:02,418
I mean, I haven't got time to tell you,
much less talk to that raving loony in there.

373
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:05,253
An absolute lunatic, he is.

374
00:31:05,384 --> 00:31:07,460
Henry.

375
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:10,595
Okay, you are in your bed, Will.

376
00:31:10,722 --> 00:31:14,422
Now, how old are you?

377
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,433
Seven.

378
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:20,052
What do you see?

379
00:31:21,273 --> 00:31:23,598
Something's in my room.

380
00:31:23,733 --> 00:31:26,687
What is it?

381
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:31,564
It's like a, uh... It's a figure.
It's, it's hoverin' over me.

382
00:31:31,698 --> 00:31:35,232
You are in a safe place, Will.

383
00:31:35,368 --> 00:31:38,950
It's t... It's touching me.

384
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,652
Where is it touching you?

385
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,541
Lt's touching me down there.

386
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,125
And, uh, I'm nervous.

387
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:51,954
You don't have to be nervous, Will.

388
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:55,922
We start dancin' and dancin'.

389
00:31:56,052 --> 00:31:59,919
It's just beautiful,
'cause we can make...

390
00:32:00,055 --> 00:32:04,468
A lot of love before the sun goes down

391
00:32:05,643 --> 00:32:09,391
Skyrockets in flight

392
00:32:09,522 --> 00:32:12,191
Afternoon delight

393
00:32:12,316 --> 00:32:15,898
- Hey, hey afternoon delight
- Jesus.

394
00:32:16,027 --> 00:32:19,312
Skyrockets in flight

395
00:32:19,447 --> 00:32:22,862
- I'm sorry, Rich.
- I have better things to do with my time.

396
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:25,992
Hey, hey afternoon delight

397
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:29,737
Come on, one dance! You, you really
hypnotized me, you know.

398
00:32:29,872 --> 00:32:31,865
- For God's sake, Will.
- What? Oh, come on.

399
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:33,991
I... He left.
You can't pin that on me.

400
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:36,747
I told you to cooperate
with these people.

401
00:32:36,878 --> 00:32:39,713
- Look into my eyes.
- Get out, Will.

402
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:44,334
- I don't need therapy.
- That's enough! Get out!

403
00:32:45,844 --> 00:32:47,718
I called Mel Weintraub this morning
to see...

404
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:50,336
Oh, what's the use?

405
00:32:50,473 --> 00:32:52,631
What do you want to do?

406
00:32:56,895 --> 00:32:59,053
- Well, there is someone.
- Who is he?

407
00:32:59,189 --> 00:33:02,273
He used to be my, um...

408
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,688
my roommate in college.

409
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,944
Trust. Very important
in a relationship.

410
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,233
It's also very important
in a clinical situation.

411
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:17,037
Why is trust
the most important thing...

412
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,534
in making a breakthrough
with a client?

413
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:26,252
Maureen, stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us.

414
00:33:26,378 --> 00:33:28,252
Vinnie?

415
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,792
Um, because, uh...

416
00:33:32,925 --> 00:33:36,045
Trust is, uh... Trust is life.

417
00:33:36,178 --> 00:33:39,760
Wow. That's very deep.
Thank you, Vinnie.

418
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,348
Next time, get the notes
from your brother.

419
00:33:41,474 --> 00:33:46,017
You know, if a patient doesn't feel safe enough
to trust you, then he won't be honest with you.

420
00:33:46,145 --> 00:33:48,102
Then there's really no point for them
being in therapy.

421
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,230
I mean, hey, if they don't trust you, you know,
you're never gonna get them to sleep with you.

422
00:33:51,358 --> 00:33:53,231
And that should be the goal
of any good therapist.

423
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:55,435
Nail them while they're vulnerable.
That's my motto.

424
00:33:56,737 --> 00:33:59,857
Oh, good, everyone's back.
Welcome back, everybody.

425
00:34:01,324 --> 00:34:05,024
- Hello, Sean.
- Hey, Gerry.

426
00:34:07,204 --> 00:34:11,913
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
we are in the presence of greatness.

427
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:16,288
Professor Gerald Lambeau, Field's medal
winner for combinatorial mathematics.

428
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:19,207
- Hello.
- Anyone know what the Field's medal is?

429
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,091
It's a really big deal.
It's like the Nobel prize for math.

430
00:34:22,217 --> 00:34:25,716
Except they only give it out
once every four years.

431
00:34:25,845 --> 00:34:28,762
It's, it's a great thing.
It's an amazing honour.

432
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:30,882
Okay, everybody, that's it for today.
Thanks. Um...

433
00:34:31,016 --> 00:34:33,803
We'll see you Monday.
We'll be talking about Freud.

434
00:34:33,935 --> 00:34:37,767
Why he did enough cocaine
to kill a small horse. Thank you.

435
00:34:38,939 --> 00:34:40,647
How are you?

436
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:43,312
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

437
00:34:43,443 --> 00:34:44,641
- Sean?
- Yeah?

438
00:34:44,778 --> 00:34:47,529
I think I got
something interesting for ya?

439
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:50,110
What? You have to have blood and urine?
What's up?

440
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:55,827
- Why didn't you come to the reunion?
- Time. You know, I'm... I've been busy.

441
00:34:55,954 --> 00:34:57,911
- You were missed.
- Really?

442
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:01,158
So, how long has it been
since we've seen each other?

443
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:04,625
- Before Nancy died.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

444
00:35:04,753 --> 00:35:07,160
I was in Paris.
It was that damn conference.

445
00:35:07,297 --> 00:35:09,004
I got your card.
It was nice.

446
00:35:14,469 --> 00:35:16,177
- Come here.
- Now, that's a good takedown.

447
00:35:16,304 --> 00:35:20,171
Hey, uh, what happened?
Did you, uh, get leniency or what?

448
00:35:20,308 --> 00:35:25,099
I got, uh, probation and then, uh,
counselling two days a week.

449
00:35:25,229 --> 00:35:28,679
Joke. You're a smoothie.
Come on, Morgan! Just submit!

450
00:35:30,149 --> 00:35:33,020
Hey, Bill, just, just get off him.
We're gonna miss the game.

451
00:35:33,152 --> 00:35:35,109
- I've got a full schedule.
- Sean, Sean. - I'm very busy.

452
00:35:35,237 --> 00:35:38,191
This, this boy is incredible.
I've never seen anything like him.

453
00:35:38,323 --> 00:35:41,407
What makes him so incredible, Gerry?

454
00:35:41,534 --> 00:35:45,780
- Ever heard of Ramanujan?
- Yeah, yeah. No.

455
00:35:45,913 --> 00:35:50,538
It's a man. He lived over 100 years ago.
He was, uh, Indian.

456
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:53,371
- Dots not feathers.
- Not feathers. Yeah.

457
00:35:53,502 --> 00:35:55,542
Well, he lived in this tiny hut
somewhere in India.

458
00:35:55,671 --> 00:35:57,912
He had no formal education.

459
00:35:58,048 --> 00:36:00,585
- He had no access to any scientific work.
- Coffee?

460
00:36:00,717 --> 00:36:02,793
- You, sir? - Just
a little. - And, um...

461
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,215
But he came across
this old math book.

462
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:08,015
And from this simple text,
he was able to extrapolate theories...

463
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,049
that had baffled mathematicians
for years.

464
00:36:10,183 --> 00:36:13,219
Yes. Continued fractions.
Yeah, he, he wrote, uh...

465
00:36:13,352 --> 00:36:17,219
- Well, he, he mailed it to Hardy at Cambridge.
- Yeah. Cambridge. Yeah.

466
00:36:17,356 --> 00:36:20,559
And Hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work...

467
00:36:20,692 --> 00:36:24,191
and brought him over to England, and
then they worked together for years...

468
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,071
creating some of the most exciting
math theory ever done.

469
00:36:27,198 --> 00:36:29,439
Uh, This, this Ramanugan...

470
00:36:29,575 --> 00:36:33,619
his, his genius was unparalleled, Sean.

471
00:36:33,745 --> 00:36:36,994
Well, this boy's just like that.

472
00:36:37,123 --> 00:36:40,657
But he's, um, he's a bit defensive.

473
00:36:40,792 --> 00:36:43,828
And I need someone
who can get through to him.

474
00:36:43,962 --> 00:36:46,583
- Like me?
- Yeah, like you.

475
00:36:46,714 --> 00:36:49,418
- Why?
- Well, because you have the same kind of background.

476
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,799
- What background?
- Well, you're from the same neighbourhood.

477
00:36:52,928 --> 00:36:55,501
- He's from Southie?
- Yeah.

478
00:36:55,638 --> 00:36:57,880
Boy genius from Southie.

479
00:36:59,225 --> 00:37:03,352
- How many shrinks you go to before me?
- Five.

480
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:06,139
- Let me guess. Barry?
- Yeah.

481
00:37:06,272 --> 00:37:07,766
- Henry? -
Yeah. - Not Rick?

482
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:10,934
Sean, please,
just meet with him once a week.

483
00:37:11,068 --> 00:37:12,977
Please?

484
00:37:16,072 --> 00:37:19,275
It's a poker game with this kid.
Don't let him know what you've got.

485
00:37:19,408 --> 00:37:22,278
He's probably even read your book,
if he could find it.

486
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:24,736
It's gonna be hard for him to find.

487
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:26,365
- Hi, Will.
- Hi.

488
00:37:26,498 --> 00:37:28,454
This is Sean Maguire. Will Hunting.

489
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:30,990
How are ya?

490
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:36,794
- Yeah, let's get started.
- Yeah, let's do it.

491
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:38,962
I'm pumped!
Let's let the healing begin.

492
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:42,590
- Will you excuse us?
- Yeah, please, Tom.

493
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,262
- You, too, Gerry.
- Yeah, of course.

494
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,141
How are you?

495
00:37:56,606 --> 00:37:58,645
Where are you from in Southie?

496
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:01,728
- I like what you've done with the place.
- Oh, thanks.

497
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:05,146
Do you buy all these books retail,
or do you send away for like...

498
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,316
a shrink kit that comes
with all these volumes included?

499
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:11,948
- Do you like books?
- Yeah.

500
00:38:12,078 --> 00:38:14,615
- Did you read any of these books?
- I don't know.

501
00:38:14,747 --> 00:38:17,118
- How about any of these books?
- Probably not.

502
00:38:17,249 --> 00:38:21,032
What about the ones on the top shelf?
You read those?

503
00:38:21,169 --> 00:38:24,786
- Yeah, I read those.
- Good for you. What do you think about 'em?

504
00:38:24,922 --> 00:38:27,839
Hey, I'm not here for a fuckin' book report.
They're your books. Why don't you read 'em?

505
00:38:27,966 --> 00:38:29,674
I did. I had to.

506
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:33,584
- It must've taken you a long time.
- Yeah, it did.

507
00:38:39,976 --> 00:38:44,602
United States of America:
A Complete History, Volume I.

508
00:38:55,322 --> 00:38:57,398
Jesus.

509
00:38:57,533 --> 00:39:00,818
If you wanna read a real history book, read Howard
Zinn's A People's History of the United States.

510
00:39:00,952 --> 00:39:02,826
That book will fuckin' knock you
on your ass.

511
00:39:02,954 --> 00:39:04,863
Better than Chomsky's
Manufacturing Consent?

512
00:39:04,997 --> 00:39:08,697
- Do you think that's a good book?
- You fuckin' people baffle me.

513
00:39:09,835 --> 00:39:11,792
You spend all your money
on these fuckin' fancy books.

514
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,541
You surround yourselves with 'em.
They're the wrong fuckin' books.

515
00:39:14,672 --> 00:39:18,539
- What are the right fuckin' books, Will?
- Hey, whatever blows your hair back.

516
00:39:18,676 --> 00:39:21,380
Yeah. Haven't got much hair left.

517
00:39:21,511 --> 00:39:25,460
Hey, you know you'd be better off shoving that cigarette
up your ass. It'd probably be healthier for you.

518
00:39:25,598 --> 00:39:29,725
- Yeah, I know. It really gets in the way of my yoga.
- You work out, huh?

519
00:39:29,852 --> 00:39:32,556
- What, you lift?
- Yeah.

520
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:34,680
- Uh, Nautilus?
- No, free weights.

521
00:39:34,814 --> 00:39:36,391
- Oh, really? - Yeah.
- Free weights, huh?

522
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:38,315
- Yeah, big time. -
Yeah? - Just like that.

523
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,731
- What do you bench?
- 285. What do you bench?

524
00:39:43,154 --> 00:39:45,230
You paint that?

525
00:39:45,365 --> 00:39:48,780
Yeah. You paint? Do you sculpt?

526
00:39:48,909 --> 00:39:50,736
- No.
- Do you like art?

527
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,239
Do you like music?

528
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:57,412
This is a real piece of shit.

529
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,415
Oh. Well, tell me
what you really think.

530
00:39:59,543 --> 00:40:02,876
Uh, just, uh, the linear
and impressionistic mix...

531
00:40:03,005 --> 00:40:05,246
makes a very muddled composition.

532
00:40:05,382 --> 00:40:09,165
It's also a Winslow Homer rip-off, except
you got whitey, uh, rowin' the boat there.

533
00:40:09,302 --> 00:40:11,175
Well, it's art, Monet.
It wasn't very good.

534
00:40:11,303 --> 00:40:13,924
- That's not really what concerns me though.
- What concerns you?

535
00:40:14,056 --> 00:40:16,463
- Just the colouring.
- You know what the real bitch of it is?

536
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,592
It's paint-by-number.

537
00:40:18,726 --> 00:40:21,181
Is it colour-by-number? Because
the colours are fascinating to me.

538
00:40:21,312 --> 00:40:22,889
- Aren't they, really? What about that?
- You bet.

539
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:25,939
I think you're about one step away
from cuttin' your fuckin' ear off.

540
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:28,141
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

541
00:40:28,276 --> 00:40:32,024
Think I should move to the south
of France, change my name to Vincent?

542
00:40:32,154 --> 00:40:33,981
You ever heard the sayin',
"any port in a storm"?

543
00:40:34,114 --> 00:40:37,031
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Maybe that means you.

544
00:40:37,158 --> 00:40:38,534
In what way?

545
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,945
- Uh, maybe you're in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin' storm.
- Yeah, maybe.

546
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,080
The sky's fallin' on your head. The
waves are crashin' over your little boat.

547
00:40:45,207 --> 00:40:47,413
The oars are about to snap.

548
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:49,202
You just piss in you pants.
You're cryin' for the harbour.

549
00:40:49,335 --> 00:40:51,624
So maybe you do
what you gotta do to get out.

550
00:40:51,754 --> 00:40:54,079
You know, maybe you became
a psychologist.

551
00:40:54,214 --> 00:40:57,797
Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now.
You start with me. Come on.

552
00:41:00,178 --> 00:41:03,926
- Maybe you married the wrong woman.
- Maybe you should watch your mouth!

553
00:41:05,682 --> 00:41:08,007
Watch it right there, chief,
all right?

554
00:41:10,603 --> 00:41:12,477
Ah.

555
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:18,731
Mmm, that's it, isn't it?

556
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,102
You married the wrong woman.

557
00:41:22,655 --> 00:41:26,984
What happened?
What, did she leave you?

558
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,406
Was she, you know,
banging some other guy?

559
00:41:31,496 --> 00:41:34,911
If you ever disrespect my wife again,
I will end you.

560
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:37,080
I will fuckin' end you.

561
00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:39,000
Got that, chief?

562
00:41:41,171 --> 00:41:45,002
- Time's up.
- Yeah.

563
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,184
At ease, gentlemen.

564
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:08,232
You okay?

565
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:17,398
Look, I'll, I'll understand
if you don't wanna meet with him again.

566
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:21,235
Thursday, 4:00.
Make sure the kid's here.

567
00:42:23,498 --> 00:42:25,786
Yeah.

568
00:42:25,917 --> 00:42:27,826
Thanks.

569
00:43:32,932 --> 00:43:35,054
Well, you look lovely in those glasses.

570
00:43:35,184 --> 00:43:36,927
- Thank you very much.
- They're just beautiful.

571
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,099
Yes, I always wanted
dark blue eye shadow.

572
00:43:39,229 --> 00:43:41,102
Wonderful.

573
00:43:43,732 --> 00:43:46,768
Growing up in England, you know,
I went to a very nice school.

574
00:43:46,902 --> 00:43:52,441
You know, it was kind of progressive,
organic, do-it-yourself, private school.

575
00:43:52,573 --> 00:43:56,784
Then Harvard. Hopefully med school.

576
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,488
You know, I figured out,
at the end...

577
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:03,412
my brain's gonna be worth $250,000.

578
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:05,782
That sounded horrible, didn't it?

579
00:44:07,753 --> 00:44:09,626
Bring me another mai tai!

580
00:44:10,755 --> 00:44:13,672
No, that's cool, I mean,
I bet your parents were happy to pay.

581
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,927
No, I was happy to pay.
I inherited the money.

582
00:44:18,053 --> 00:44:21,422
Wow. Well, is, uh,
is Harvard gettin' all that money?

583
00:44:21,556 --> 00:44:24,426
No. Stanford. I'm going there in June
when I graduate.

584
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:28,769
All right, so you just wanted to, to use
this sailor and then, uh, run away, huh?

585
00:44:28,896 --> 00:44:32,940
I was gonna, you know, experiment on you
for anatomy class first, obviously.

586
00:44:33,066 --> 00:44:35,023
Oh, in that case, that's fine.

587
00:44:35,151 --> 00:44:37,024
Hey, you wanna see my magic tricks,
Skylar?

588
00:44:37,153 --> 00:44:39,608
- Of course.
- All right. Promise...

589
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:43,731
All right.

590
00:44:43,867 --> 00:44:47,567
- This one's for you, Rudolph.
- Wait, wait, you need my wand.

591
00:44:47,703 --> 00:44:50,324
All right, give me a hit.
Thank you. All right.

592
00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:52,448
I'm gonna make
all these caramels disappear.

593
00:44:52,582 --> 00:44:55,334
You ready? Ready.

594
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,997
One, two, three.

595
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:03,673
They're all gone. Yeah. That, that was...
It works better when I have my rabbit.

596
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,670
Well...

597
00:45:06,803 --> 00:45:09,258
I don't really date, you know,
that much.

598
00:45:09,388 --> 00:45:12,673
How very unfortunate, I think for me.

599
00:45:14,601 --> 00:45:17,554
You know what I mean.
I know you've been thinking about uh...

600
00:45:17,687 --> 00:45:19,430
- Oh, no, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

601
00:45:19,563 --> 00:45:22,647
- No, I really haven't.
- Yes, you have! You were hoping to get a good night kiss.

602
00:45:22,774 --> 00:45:27,021
No, you know, I tell ya.
I was hoping to get good-night laid.

603
00:45:28,279 --> 00:45:30,604
But I'll settle for like a good kiss,
you know.

604
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:34,190
- How very noble of you.
- Thank you.

605
00:45:34,326 --> 00:45:37,279
No, I was, I was hopin' for a kiss.

606
00:45:38,621 --> 00:45:41,871
Well, I think we should just get it
out of the way now.

607
00:45:42,916 --> 00:45:45,489
- Right now?
- Yeah.

608
00:45:45,627 --> 00:45:47,500
Come on.

609
00:45:56,011 --> 00:45:58,548
I think I got some of your pickle.

610
00:46:09,939 --> 00:46:11,813
You again, huh?

611
00:46:13,192 --> 00:46:14,686
Come with me.

612
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:27,026
So what's this? A Taster's Choice
moment between guys?

613
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:30,412
This is really nice.
You got a thing for swans?

614
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:34,074
Is this like a fetish? Ls it something
like maybe we need to devote some time to?

615
00:46:35,878 --> 00:46:40,089
I thought about what you said to me
the other day. About my painting.

616
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:41,413
Oh.

617
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:44,170
Stayed up half the night
thinkin' about it.

618
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,717
Something occurred to me.

619
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:52,306
I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep
and haven't thought about you since.

620
00:46:52,433 --> 00:46:55,387
- You know what occurred to me?
- No.

621
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:59,647
You're just a kid. You don't have the
faintest idea what you're talking about.

622
00:46:59,773 --> 00:47:03,272
- Why, thank you.
- It's all right.

623
00:47:03,401 --> 00:47:05,726
You've never been out of Boston.

624
00:47:07,988 --> 00:47:09,612
Nope.

625
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:14,733
So if I asked you about art, you'd probably give
me the skinny on every art book ever written.

626
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:18,736
Michelangelo.
You know a lot about him.

627
00:47:18,872 --> 00:47:22,241
Life's work. Political aspirations.
Him and the pope.

628
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:26,835
Sexual orientation.
The whole works, right?

629
00:47:26,962 --> 00:47:31,209
I bet you can't tell me what
it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.

630
00:47:33,426 --> 00:47:37,470
You never actually stood there
and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.

631
00:47:40,265 --> 00:47:42,803
Seen that.

632
00:47:42,934 --> 00:47:44,808
If I ask you about women...

633
00:47:44,936 --> 00:47:48,518
you'll probably give me a syllabus
of your personal favourites.

634
00:47:48,647 --> 00:47:51,138
You may have even been laid
a few times.

635
00:47:56,946 --> 00:48:00,112
But you can't tell me what it feels like
to wake up next to a woman...

636
00:48:00,241 --> 00:48:02,565
and feel truly happy.

637
00:48:05,787 --> 00:48:07,660
You're a tough kid.

638
00:48:09,457 --> 00:48:13,039
I ask you about war, you'd probably, uh,
throw Shakespeare at me, right?

639
00:48:13,168 --> 00:48:16,453
"Once more into the breach,
dear friends. "

640
00:48:18,131 --> 00:48:21,084
But you've never been near one.

641
00:48:21,217 --> 00:48:23,968
You've never held
your best friend's head in your lap...

642
00:48:24,094 --> 00:48:28,091
and watch him gasp his last breath
lookin' to you for help.

643
00:48:30,391 --> 00:48:33,842
I ask you about love,
you'd probably quote me a sonnet...

644
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:39,855
but you've never looked at a woman
and been totally vulnerable.

645
00:48:39,982 --> 00:48:44,062
Known someone that could
level you with her eyes.

646
00:48:44,194 --> 00:48:48,690
Feelin' like God put an angel on Earth
just for you...

647
00:48:48,823 --> 00:48:51,528
who could rescue you
from the depths of hell.

648
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:54,944
And you wouldn't know
what it's like to be her angel...

649
00:48:55,078 --> 00:48:58,114
to have that love for her
be there forever.

650
00:48:58,248 --> 00:49:02,708
Through anything. Through cancer.

651
00:49:02,835 --> 00:49:06,879
And you wouldn't know about sleepin' sittin' up in
a hospital room for two months holding her hand...

652
00:49:07,005 --> 00:49:08,914
because the doctors could see
in your eyes...

653
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:12,168
that the terms "visiting hours"
don't apply to you.

654
00:49:13,969 --> 00:49:16,092
You don't know about real loss...

655
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:19,886
'cause that only occurs when you love
something more than you love yourself.

656
00:49:21,309 --> 00:49:24,724
I doubt you've ever dared
to love anybody that much.

657
00:49:27,648 --> 00:49:32,641
I look at you, I don't see
an intelligent, confident man.

658
00:49:34,862 --> 00:49:38,231
I see a cocky, scared shitless kid.

659
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:43,283
But you're a genius, Will.
No one denies that.

660
00:49:43,411 --> 00:49:46,993
No one could possibly understand
the depths of you.

661
00:49:47,122 --> 00:49:50,076
But you presume to know everything about
me because you saw a painting of mine.

662
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:52,877
You ripped my fuckin' life apart.

663
00:49:56,881 --> 00:49:58,837
You're an orphan, right?

664
00:50:03,261 --> 00:50:06,843
Do you think I'd know the first thing
about how hard your life has been...

665
00:50:06,972 --> 00:50:09,545
how you feel, who you are...

666
00:50:09,683 --> 00:50:12,968
because I read Oliver Twist?

667
00:50:13,103 --> 00:50:15,510
Does that encapsulate you?

668
00:50:17,732 --> 00:50:20,269
Personally, I don't give a shit
about all that.

669
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,560
Because you know what? I can't learn anything
from you I can't read in some fuckin' book.

670
00:50:27,198 --> 00:50:31,361
Unless you want to talk about you,
who you are.

671
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:36,913
Then I'm fascinated.
I'm in.

672
00:50:38,874 --> 00:50:41,626
But you don't wanna do that,
do you, sport?

673
00:50:44,254 --> 00:50:46,127
You're terrified
of what you might say.

674
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:54,211
Your move, chief.

675
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:03,977
Hello? Hello?

676
00:52:05,531 --> 00:52:06,941
Hello?

677
00:52:07,908 --> 00:52:09,900
Professor Valenti,
are you calling me again?

678
00:52:13,704 --> 00:52:14,735
Freak.

679
00:52:16,749 --> 00:52:19,500
Oh. Oh, God.

680
00:52:19,626 --> 00:52:22,829
- Christ, who did you call?
- No one. I forgot the number.

681
00:52:22,962 --> 00:52:26,413
You fuckin' retarded? You went all the way out
there in the rain, and you didn't bring the number?

682
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:29,715
No, it was your mother's 900 number.
I just ran out of quarters.

683
00:52:29,843 --> 00:52:33,046
Why don't we get off of mothers?
I just got off of yours.

684
00:52:34,347 --> 00:52:37,798
That's pretty funny, Morgan.
That's a fuckin' nickel, bitch!

685
00:52:37,933 --> 00:52:40,175
- Keep antagonizing me, watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.

686
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,101
- Watch what happens. - All right,
then, Morgan! - Watch what happens.

687
00:52:42,228 --> 00:52:44,268
- What are you gonna fuckin' do to me?
- Keep fuckin' with me.

688
00:52:50,402 --> 00:52:52,275
No smoking.

689
00:53:24,222 --> 00:53:26,677
What do you mean, he didn't talk?
You were in there for an hour.

690
00:53:26,808 --> 00:53:30,010
He just sat there counting the seconds
until the session was over.

691
00:53:30,144 --> 00:53:32,848
- It's pretty impressive, actually.
- Why would he do that?

692
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:36,929
To prove to me he doesn't have
to talk to me if he doesn't want to.

693
00:53:37,066 --> 00:53:40,933
What is this? Some kind of staring contest
between two kids from the old neighbourhood?

694
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:45,019
Yeah, it is,
and I can't talk first.

695
00:53:45,157 --> 00:53:49,023
We know your theory, Alexander, but the
boy's found a simple geometrical picture.

696
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:53,204
- A tree structure won't work.
- Look now. He's joining the two vertices.

697
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:57,244
- But I can do the sum.
- Well, it's how you group the terms, Alexander.

698
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:00,292
But, Gerry, if we do the whole thing
this way, then...

699
00:54:00,419 --> 00:54:03,124
Hey, look, look.

700
00:54:03,255 --> 00:54:06,256
I wrote it down.
It's simpler this way.

701
00:54:17,184 --> 00:54:20,101
Sometimes people get lucky.

702
00:54:20,228 --> 00:54:22,137
You're a brilliant man.

703
00:54:59,469 --> 00:55:02,007
You know, I was on this plane once.

704
00:55:02,138 --> 00:55:04,711
And I'm sittin' there, and, uh...

705
00:55:04,849 --> 00:55:08,431
the captain gets on, he does his whole, you
know, "We'll be cruisin' at 35,000 feet. "

706
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,599
But then he puts the mike down,
he forgets to turn it off.

707
00:55:11,688 --> 00:55:14,523
And so he turns to the copilot.
He's like, "You know...

708
00:55:14,649 --> 00:55:18,977
all I could use right now is
a fuckin' blow job and a cup of coffee. "

709
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:23,108
So the stewardess fuckin' goes bombin' up from the
back of the plane to tell him the microphone's still on.

710
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:25,944
This buy in the back of the plane's like,
"Hey, hon, don't forget the coffee. "

711
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:30,492
You ever been on a plane?

712
00:55:30,621 --> 00:55:33,574
No, but it's a fuckin' joke. It works
better if I tell it in the first person.

713
00:55:33,706 --> 00:55:35,580
Yeah, it does.

714
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,661
I have been laid, you know.

715
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:43,286
Really? Goody for you.

716
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,000
- Big time. Big time.
- Big time, huh?

717
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:48,217
Yeah. I went on a date last week.

718
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:51,261
- How'd it go?
- It was good.

719
00:55:51,388 --> 00:55:53,131
- You goin' out again?
- I don't know.

720
00:55:53,265 --> 00:55:55,056
- Why not?
- Haven't called her.

721
00:55:55,183 --> 00:55:58,433
- Christ, you're an amateur. -
I know what I'm doin'. - Really?

722
00:55:58,561 --> 00:56:02,724
Yeah. Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doin'.

723
00:56:02,856 --> 00:56:05,144
Yeah, but this girl is like,
you know, beautiful.

724
00:56:05,275 --> 00:56:09,770
She's smart. She's fun. She's different
from most of the girls I've been with.

725
00:56:09,904 --> 00:56:11,730
So call her up, Romeo.

726
00:56:11,864 --> 00:56:13,655
Why? So I can realize
she's not that smart?

727
00:56:13,782 --> 00:56:16,023
That she's fuckin' boring?
You know, I mean, you don't...

728
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:19,610
This girl is like fuckin' perfect
right now. I don't wanna r-ruin that.

729
00:56:20,621 --> 00:56:23,621
Maybe you're perfect right now.
Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.

730
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:27,289
But I think that's
a super philosophy, Will.

731
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:31,665
That way you can go through your entire life
without ever having to really know anybody.

732
00:56:35,842 --> 00:56:37,799
My wife used to fart
when she was nervous.

733
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:40,252
She had all sorts
of wonderful idiosyncrasies.

734
00:56:40,388 --> 00:56:43,590
You know, she used to fart
in her sleep.

735
00:56:44,558 --> 00:56:46,515
Sorry I shared that with you.

736
00:56:46,643 --> 00:56:50,142
And one night it was so loud,
it woke the dog up.

737
00:56:53,065 --> 00:56:54,773
She woke up and gone like,
"Was that you?"

738
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,853
I said, "Yeah. " I didn't have the heart
to tell her. Oh, God.

739
00:56:57,986 --> 00:57:00,477
- She woke herself up?
- Yes.

740
00:57:05,617 --> 00:57:10,824
Oh, Christ. Ah, but, Will, she's been dead
two years and that's the shit I remember.

741
00:57:10,955 --> 00:57:13,660
It's wonderful stuff, you know?
Little things like that.

742
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:18,120
Yeah, but those are the things
I miss the most.

743
00:57:18,253 --> 00:57:21,419
The little idiosyncrasies
that only I knew about.

744
00:57:21,547 --> 00:57:23,872
That's what made her my wife.

745
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:27,211
Boy, and she had the goods on me, too.
She knew all my little peccadillos.

746
00:57:28,136 --> 00:57:31,719
People call these things imperfections,
but they're not.

747
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:34,338
Oh, that's the good stuff.

748
00:57:34,475 --> 00:57:37,974
And then we get to choose who we let
into our weird little worlds.

749
00:57:39,938 --> 00:57:41,930
You're not perfect, sport.

750
00:57:42,065 --> 00:57:44,104
And let me save you the suspense.

751
00:57:44,233 --> 00:57:47,234
This girl you met,
she isn't perfect either.

752
00:57:47,361 --> 00:57:51,109
But the question is whether or not
you're perfect for each other.

753
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:54,608
That's the whole deal.
That's what intimacy is all about.

754
00:57:55,743 --> 00:57:57,237
Now, you can know everything
in the world, sport...

755
00:57:57,369 --> 00:58:00,738
but the only way you're findin' out
that one is by givin' it a shot.

756
00:58:00,872 --> 00:58:03,577
You certainly won't learn
from an old fucker like me.

757
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:08,085
Even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell a pissant like you.

758
00:58:08,212 --> 00:58:13,169
Yeah, why not? You told me
every other fuckin' thing. Jesus Christ.

759
00:58:13,299 --> 00:58:15,707
You fuckin' talk more than any shrink
I ever seen in my life.

760
00:58:15,843 --> 00:58:19,923
I teach the shit.
I didn't say I knew how to do it.

761
00:58:20,055 --> 00:58:21,964
Yeah.

762
00:58:26,602 --> 00:58:30,551
- You ever think about gettin' remarried?
- My wife's dead.

763
00:58:30,689 --> 00:58:33,808
- Hence the word "remarried. "
- She's dead!

764
00:58:36,736 --> 00:58:39,606
Yeah. Well, I think that's
a super philosophy, Sean.

765
00:58:39,738 --> 00:58:41,778
I mean, that way you can actually
go through the rest of your life...

766
00:58:41,907 --> 00:58:43,698
without ever really knowing anybody.

767
00:58:47,036 --> 00:58:48,316
Time's up.

768
00:59:03,717 --> 00:59:05,460
Hold it open.

769
00:59:05,594 --> 00:59:07,586
- Okay.
- Thank you.

770
00:59:20,731 --> 00:59:23,400
I am happy with you

771
00:59:24,651 --> 00:59:28,565
I know I'm about to love you

772
00:59:28,696 --> 00:59:34,034
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know him

773
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:37,113
Oh, my, you made me...

774
00:59:37,245 --> 00:59:39,617
"G" minor seventh.
Saddest of all chords.

775
00:59:42,041 --> 00:59:43,832
- Hello.
- Hey.

776
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:46,794
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry. I've been like...

777
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,541
I've been really busy, and...
But, um...

778
00:59:49,672 --> 00:59:52,245
Me, too. Yeah.

779
00:59:52,383 --> 00:59:55,170
I... I thought you'd call.

780
00:59:56,887 --> 00:59:58,713
Yeah. Um...

781
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,804
- I mean, we had a really good time.
- I had a really good time, too.

782
01:00:00,932 --> 01:00:02,971
I mean, I just... I...

783
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,009
I'm sorry, you know.
I, I blew it.

784
01:00:05,144 --> 01:00:07,469
No, no. I mean, you know,
it's all right.

785
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:12,728
Yeah. Uh, so I was, I was wonderin' if, uh,
if, you know, you'd give me another crack at it.

786
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:16,523
- You know, let me take you out again.
- Oh, I can't.

787
01:00:17,738 --> 01:00:19,647
- All right.
- Oh, no. I didn't...

788
01:00:19,781 --> 01:00:23,613
I didn't mean I can't, like ever.
I just can't right now.

789
01:00:23,743 --> 01:00:26,696
I've got to assign the proton spectrum
for "ebogamine. "

790
01:00:26,829 --> 01:00:28,738
All that sounds really, really
interesting.

791
01:00:28,872 --> 01:00:30,746
It's actually fantastically boring.

792
01:00:30,874 --> 01:00:33,578
- All right, um...
- But, um, maybe some other time.

793
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:37,078
- Like tomorrow?
- Um, yeah, all right.

794
01:00:37,213 --> 01:00:39,501
- Okay.
- Okay.

795
01:00:39,631 --> 01:00:41,505
- Bye.
- Bye.

796
01:00:56,562 --> 01:00:59,349
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't wait till tomorrow.

797
01:01:00,941 --> 01:01:04,523
- Where the fuck did you get this?
- I had to sleep with someone in your class.

798
01:01:04,652 --> 01:01:08,317
Oh, I hope it was someone with the
open-toed sandals and the really bad breath.

799
01:01:10,407 --> 01:01:14,274
- Come on, let's go have some fun.
- No, I... I've got to learn this.

800
01:01:14,411 --> 01:01:16,948
Well, you're not goin' to his surgery
tomorrow, are you?

801
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:19,072
- No.
- Let's go.

802
01:01:23,168 --> 01:01:26,619
Oh, my God. My dog is winning!

803
01:01:27,463 --> 01:01:29,041
Come on, Misty!

804
01:01:29,173 --> 01:01:31,794
Come on, run! Look at that!
Come on!

805
01:01:31,925 --> 01:01:33,799
Look, there he goes.
Misty, run! Come on!

806
01:01:34,803 --> 01:01:38,800
- And Misty flying down the track.
- We won.

807
01:01:38,931 --> 01:01:40,840
I totally won!

808
01:01:42,893 --> 01:01:46,807
- So did you grow up around here, then?
- Not far. South Boston.

809
01:01:49,524 --> 01:01:51,765
- Still glowing from my win.
- Yeah, I know. Look at you.

810
01:01:51,901 --> 01:01:53,774
You're so happy.

811
01:01:55,946 --> 01:02:00,903
- What was that like then?
- It was, you know, normal I guess. Nothin' special.

812
01:02:02,284 --> 01:02:04,324
Do you got lots of brothers and sisters?

813
01:02:04,453 --> 01:02:07,074
- Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
- That's what I said.

814
01:02:07,205 --> 01:02:09,244
Well, Irish Catholic,
what do you think?

815
01:02:09,374 --> 01:02:11,781
Right. That's right.

816
01:02:13,252 --> 01:02:17,000
- How many?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

817
01:02:18,715 --> 01:02:21,751
- Why? Go on. What? Five?
- No.

818
01:02:21,884 --> 01:02:25,087
Seven? Eight? How many?

819
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:27,343
- I have 12 big brothers.
- You do not have 12 brothers.

820
01:02:27,472 --> 01:02:30,259
I swear to God, I swear to God.
I'm lucky 13 right here.

821
01:02:30,391 --> 01:02:33,261
Do you know all their names?

822
01:02:33,394 --> 01:02:36,098
- Do I... Yeah, they're my brothers.
- What are they called?

823
01:02:37,439 --> 01:02:41,518
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

824
01:02:41,651 --> 01:02:43,727
Say it again.

825
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:48,190
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

826
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:51,933
- And Willy.
- Willy?

827
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:53,434
- Yeah.
- Will.

828
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:56,596
Wow! Do you still see all of them?

829
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:59,517
Yeah, well, they all live in Southie. I'm,
I'm livin' with three of 'em right now.

830
01:02:59,649 --> 01:03:00,764
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

831
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,767
- Well, I'd like to meet them.
- Yeah, we'll do that.

832
01:03:05,863 --> 01:03:07,273
Oh, you know, I read your book
last night.

833
01:03:07,406 --> 01:03:10,027
Oh, so you're the one.

834
01:03:10,158 --> 01:03:12,067
Do you still, uh, do you still
counsel veterans?

835
01:03:12,201 --> 01:03:13,399
- No, I don't.
- Why not?

836
01:03:13,536 --> 01:03:15,611
Well, I gave it up
when my wife got sick.

837
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:21,451
You ever wonder what your life
would be like if you, uh...

838
01:03:21,584 --> 01:03:23,956
if you never met your wife?

839
01:03:24,086 --> 01:03:26,542
- What, wonder if I'd be better off without her?
- No, no, no.

840
01:03:26,672 --> 01:03:29,293
- I'm not saying like better off. I didn't mean it like that.
- No, it's all right.

841
01:03:29,424 --> 01:03:31,962
It's an important question.

842
01:03:32,093 --> 01:03:34,418
'Cause you'll have bad times,
but that'll always wake you up...

843
01:03:34,553 --> 01:03:36,712
to the good stuff
you weren't paying attention to.

844
01:03:37,514 --> 01:03:39,388
And you don't regret
meetin' your wife?

845
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:42,137
Why? 'Cause the pain I feel now?

846
01:03:42,268 --> 01:03:46,597
Oh, I got regrets, Will, but I don't
regret a single day I spent with her.

847
01:03:51,985 --> 01:03:54,820
So when did you know, like,
that she was the one for you?

848
01:03:54,946 --> 01:03:57,615
October 21, 1975.

849
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:59,732
Jesus Christ, you know the fuckin' day?

850
01:03:59,866 --> 01:04:04,824
Oh, yeah, 'cause it was game six of the
World Series, biggest game in Red Sox history.

851
01:04:04,954 --> 01:04:06,152
Yeah, sure.

852
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:09,989
My friends and I had, you know, slept out
on the sidewalk all night to get tickets.

853
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:13,576
- You got tickets?
- Yep. Day of the game I was sittin' in a bar...

854
01:04:13,712 --> 01:04:17,162
waitin' for the game to start,
and in walks this girl.

855
01:04:17,298 --> 01:04:20,133
It was an amazing game, though. You
know, bottom of the 8th, Carbo ties it up.

856
01:04:20,259 --> 01:04:22,796
It was 6-6.
It went to 12.

857
01:04:22,928 --> 01:04:27,672
Bottom of the 12th, in stepped Carlton
Fisk, old Pudge. Steps up to the plate.

858
01:04:27,807 --> 01:04:29,514
- You know, he's got that weird stance.
- Yeah, yeah.

859
01:04:29,642 --> 01:04:32,512
And then, boom!
He clocks it, you know. High!

860
01:04:32,644 --> 01:04:35,051
Fly ball down the left field line!

861
01:04:35,188 --> 01:04:38,105
35,000 people on their feet
yellin' at the ball.

862
01:04:38,232 --> 01:04:40,604
But that's nothin', 'cause Fisk,
he's wavin' at the ball like a madman.

863
01:04:40,734 --> 01:04:42,477
- You know, "Get over! Get over!"
- Yeah, I've seen that. Right. Right.

864
01:04:42,611 --> 01:04:45,814
"Get over!" And then it hits
the foul pole.

865
01:04:45,947 --> 01:04:50,608
Well, he goes ape-shit, and 35,000 fans,
you know, they charge the field. You know?

866
01:04:50,743 --> 01:04:53,031
- Yeah, and he's fuckin' blowin' people outta the way.
- And he's goin', goin', "Look out!

867
01:04:53,161 --> 01:04:55,201
Get outta the way!
Get outta the way!"

868
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:58,449
I can't fuckin' believe you had tickets to
that fuckin' game! Did you rush the field?

869
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:01,583
No, I didn't rush the fuckin' field.
I wasn't there.

870
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:04,711
- What?
- No, I was in a bar having a drink with my future wife.

871
01:05:04,838 --> 01:05:06,795
- You missed Pudge Fisk's home run?
- Oh, yeah.

872
01:05:06,923 --> 01:05:09,211
To have a fuckin' drink with some lady
you never met?

873
01:05:09,342 --> 01:05:11,548
Yeah, but you should've seen her.
She was a stunner.

874
01:05:11,677 --> 01:05:14,215
- I don't care if fuckin'...
- Oh, no, no, she lit up the room.

875
01:05:14,346 --> 01:05:17,300
- I don't care if Helen of Troy walks into the room! That's game six!
- Oh, Helen of Troy.

876
01:05:17,432 --> 01:05:20,468
Oh, my God. And who are these fuckin' friends
of yours? They let you get away with that?

877
01:05:20,601 --> 01:05:23,222
- Oh, they had to. - What do you mean,
they had? W- What did you say to 'em?

878
01:05:23,354 --> 01:05:25,725
I just slid my ticket across the table
and I said...

879
01:05:25,856 --> 01:05:29,189
"Sorry, guys. I gotta see about a girl. "

880
01:05:29,317 --> 01:05:31,475
"I gotta go see about a girl"?
Yeah, that's what you said?

881
01:05:31,611 --> 01:05:33,021
- I had to.
- And they let you get away with that?

882
01:05:33,154 --> 01:05:35,858
Oh, yeah. They saw it in my eyes
that I meant it.

883
01:05:35,989 --> 01:05:39,073
- You're kiddin' me?
- No, I'm not kidding you, Will.

884
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,738
That's why I'm not talkin' right now about
some girl I saw at a bar 20 years ago...

885
01:05:41,869 --> 01:05:44,953
and how I always regretted
not goin' over and talkin' to her.

886
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,571
I don't regret the 18 years
I was married to Nancy.

887
01:05:47,707 --> 01:05:50,578
I don't regret the six years I had to
give up counselling when she got sick.

888
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:53,497
And I don't regret the last years
when she got really sick.

889
01:05:55,047 --> 01:05:58,297
And I sure as hell don't regret
missin' a damn game.

890
01:05:58,425 --> 01:06:00,002
That's regret.

891
01:06:00,135 --> 01:06:02,008
Wow!

892
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:10,015
Would've been nice
to catch that game, though.

893
01:06:10,143 --> 01:06:12,468
I didn't know Pudge
was gonna hit a home run.

894
01:06:15,564 --> 01:06:20,107
You know, I'm very, very useful
on the court. I'm extremely tall.

895
01:06:22,153 --> 01:06:24,858
- You're not that tall.
- I dunk.

896
01:06:27,574 --> 01:06:30,943
Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?

897
01:06:31,077 --> 01:06:34,244
"It is decidedly so. " Hmph.

898
01:06:37,082 --> 01:06:40,118
Why do we always stay here?

899
01:06:40,252 --> 01:06:42,328
'Cause it's nicer than my place.

900
01:06:42,462 --> 01:06:44,869
Yes, but I've never seen your place.

901
01:06:45,006 --> 01:06:47,164
I know.

902
01:06:47,299 --> 01:06:49,790
When am I gonna meet your friends
and your brothers?

903
01:06:49,927 --> 01:06:53,260
Oh. Well, they don't really
come down here that much.

904
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:55,546
Well, I think I can make it
to South Boston.

905
01:06:57,016 --> 01:06:59,471
It's kind of a hike.

906
01:06:59,601 --> 01:07:03,301
Is it me you're hiding from them
or the other way around?

907
01:07:03,438 --> 01:07:06,438
- All right, we'll go.
- When?

908
01:07:06,566 --> 01:07:09,317
I don't know.
We'll go sometime next week.

909
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:13,985
What if I said I would not sleep with you
again until you let me meet your friends?

910
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:23,152
I'd say it's, like, 4:30 in the mornin'.
They're probably up.

911
01:07:23,288 --> 01:07:26,657
Oh, my God.
Men are shameless.

912
01:07:26,791 --> 01:07:29,875
If you're not thinking with your wiener,
then you're acting directly on its behalf.

913
01:07:30,002 --> 01:07:34,248
You bet. And on behalf of my wiener,
can I get like an advance payment?

914
01:07:34,381 --> 01:07:36,338
I don't know. Let's ask.

915
01:07:37,717 --> 01:07:39,958
- "Outlook does not look good. "
- What?

916
01:07:40,094 --> 01:07:42,667
Fuck the... Hey, Chuck. No, nothing.
Go back to sleep.

917
01:07:42,805 --> 01:07:45,888
"Outlook does not... " That's the same thing that told
you you was gonna play in the N.B.A. I think I'm in.

918
01:07:46,016 --> 01:07:49,052
Well, exactly, so look out. You better
start buying some season tickets.

919
01:07:51,812 --> 01:07:55,430
I- I plan to. I'm tall.
I like wearing shorts.

920
01:07:55,565 --> 01:07:57,356
Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.

921
01:07:57,484 --> 01:08:00,188
- You're not that tall.
- Yes, I am.

922
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:02,477
Maybe I'm all about three points.

923
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:05,404
I'm all about home runs.

924
01:08:06,825 --> 01:08:10,193
Stop mixing your sporting metaphors.

925
01:08:22,672 --> 01:08:24,878
A leprechaun's got his dick
in the monkey's ass.

926
01:08:25,007 --> 01:08:28,671
And Morgan comes runnin' in, goin',
"I don't mind it. I don't mind... "

927
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:34,885
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here
when we're fuckin' all bombed and drinkin'.

928
01:08:35,015 --> 01:08:37,055
I know, Morgan. It's a real rarity
we'd be all drinkin'.

929
01:08:37,184 --> 01:08:41,181
You know, my Uncle Marty drinks. You know.
He'll go on a bender for six, eight months.

930
01:08:41,312 --> 01:08:43,850
I ever tell you what happened to him when he
was drivin' up there and he got pulled over?

931
01:08:43,981 --> 01:08:45,724
- I told you guys, right?
- Marty, Marty, yeah.

932
01:08:45,858 --> 01:08:47,601
Let me tell you about... Let me tell ya
what happened to my Uncle Marty...

933
01:08:47,734 --> 01:08:49,976
because you oughta know this.

934
01:08:50,111 --> 01:08:53,527
He's always tellin' stories. Every time
we come here, he's got another story.

935
01:08:53,656 --> 01:08:57,487
But we all heard this one.
Go ahead, just say it anyway. Go ahead.

936
01:08:57,618 --> 01:09:01,401
I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.
Guess I have the floor now.

937
01:09:01,538 --> 01:09:05,535
Um, yeah, my Uncle Marty's
drivin' home, right?

938
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:10,411
Bombed out of his tree, right? Just
hammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked!

939
01:09:10,545 --> 01:09:13,036
This state trooper, uh, sees him
and pulls him over.

940
01:09:13,172 --> 01:09:16,090
So my uncle's fucked, basically. Got him out
of the car, and tried to make him walk the line.

941
01:09:16,217 --> 01:09:20,843
He gets out of the car, you know, pukes and the
guy statie's pretty sure he's over the legal limit.

942
01:09:20,971 --> 01:09:24,588
So, he's about to throw the cuffs on him
and put him in jail.

943
01:09:24,724 --> 01:09:28,768
All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road
there's this huge fuckin' boom, right?

944
01:09:28,894 --> 01:09:32,428
- So statie gets real spooked, and he turns around...
- He got shot?

945
01:09:32,564 --> 01:09:34,224
- No, no.
- So, so...

946
01:09:34,357 --> 01:09:37,274
- You've heard this story before.
- Yeah, Morgan, stop it. Stop it.

947
01:09:37,401 --> 01:09:40,852
Some other guy's car had hit a tree.
Okay? There was an accident.

948
01:09:42,572 --> 01:09:45,442
- Anyway... Shut the fuck up!
- How could he hear the other car accident if it wasn't right behind him?

949
01:09:45,575 --> 01:09:48,112
- I'm gonna break your neck. - You're driving
him nuts, Morgan. - Shut up! Okay, shut up.

950
01:09:48,244 --> 01:09:49,951
- Sorry.
- He told you the story once before. Go ahead.

951
01:09:50,079 --> 01:09:52,486
So he tells my uncle,
"Stay here. Don't move. "

952
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:56,785
So statie goes runnin' down the road
to deal with the other accident.

953
01:09:56,918 --> 01:10:00,500
After a few minutes of, of just lyin'
in his own piss and vomit...

954
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:02,954
my uncle st-starts wonderin'
what he's doin' there.

955
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:05,414
Gets up, gets in his car
and just drives home.

956
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:08,467
Well, the next mornin',
my uncle's just passed out...

957
01:10:08,594 --> 01:10:10,633
and he hears this knocking at the door.

958
01:10:10,763 --> 01:10:13,847
So he goes downstairs,
fuckin' pulls the door open. "What?"

959
01:10:13,974 --> 01:10:15,966
It's the state trooper
that pulled him over.

960
01:10:16,101 --> 01:10:18,722
Statie says, "Fuck you mean, 'What? '
You know what.

961
01:10:18,853 --> 01:10:21,640
I pulled you over last night is what,
and you fuckin' took off. "

962
01:10:21,772 --> 01:10:24,060
He's like, "Bet you I never seen you
before in my life.

963
01:10:24,191 --> 01:10:27,061
I've been home all night with my kids.
I don't know who the fuck you are. "

964
01:10:27,193 --> 01:10:30,396
He said, "You know who I am.
Let me get in your garage. "

965
01:10:30,529 --> 01:10:32,818
My uncle's like, "What?" He said, "You
heard me. Let met get in your garage. "

966
01:10:32,948 --> 01:10:35,617
My uncle's like, "All right, fine. " Takes
him 'round to the garage, opens the door.

967
01:10:35,742 --> 01:10:40,818
And there's... The statie's police
cruiser is in my uncle's garage.

968
01:10:42,289 --> 01:10:45,954
He was so fuckin'... He was so fuckin'
hammered, he drove the wrong car home.

969
01:10:46,084 --> 01:10:49,666
And the best part about it is
the fuckin' state trooper...

970
01:10:49,796 --> 01:10:52,251
had been so embarrassed,
he didn't do anything...

971
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:55,750
'cause he'd been drivin' around all night
in my uncle's Chevelle lookin' for the house.

972
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:59,798
All right, Chuck, what the fuck
is the point of your story?

973
01:10:59,929 --> 01:11:01,838
Well, he goes away.
That's the point.

974
01:11:01,973 --> 01:11:05,341
- All right. Well, question. Are you...
- Come on, stop.

975
01:11:05,476 --> 01:11:07,847
I'm tryin' to clarify somethin', probably
'cause you're too embarrassed to ask...

976
01:11:07,978 --> 01:11:09,851
'cause you know
it doesn't make any sense.

977
01:11:09,979 --> 01:11:12,814
It does make sense if you listen
to the story and quit askin' questions.

978
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:16,190
Morgan, let's see if you can get this
one. I've got a little story for ya.

979
01:11:16,318 --> 01:11:21,774
All right. There's an old couple
in bed. Mary and Paddie.

980
01:11:21,906 --> 01:11:26,698
And they wake up on the morning
of their 50th anniversary.

981
01:11:26,827 --> 01:11:29,199
And Mary looks over
and gazes adoringly at Paddie.

982
01:11:29,329 --> 01:11:34,323
She's like, "Oh, Jesus, Paddie. You're
such a good-lookin' fella. I love ya.

983
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:36,616
I want to give ya
a little present.

984
01:11:36,752 --> 01:11:39,788
Anything your little heart desires,
I'm goin' to give it to ya.

985
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:41,795
What would you like?"

986
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:46,383
Paddie's like, "Oh, gee, Mary.
That's a very sweet offer.

987
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:51,421
Now, in 50 years,
there's one thing that's been missin'...

988
01:11:51,556 --> 01:11:56,217
and, uh, I would like you
to give me a blow job.

989
01:11:56,352 --> 01:11:59,139
I would like for it. "
And Mary's like, "All right. "

990
01:11:59,271 --> 01:12:03,600
She takes her teeth out, puts them in
the glass, and she gives him a blow job.

991
01:12:03,733 --> 01:12:07,564
And afterwards, Paddie's like, "Yeah,
geez, now that's what I've been missin'.

992
01:12:07,695 --> 01:12:11,562
That was the most beautiful,
earth-shattering thing ever!

993
01:12:11,698 --> 01:12:13,774
Beautiful, Mary! I love ya!

994
01:12:13,908 --> 01:12:16,992
Is there anything
that I can do for you?"

995
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:21,745
And Mary looks up to him
and she goes, "Give us a kiss. "

996
01:12:21,873 --> 01:12:25,123
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

997
01:12:25,251 --> 01:12:27,576
- That's filthy.
- Not that filthy. I've heard filthier.

998
01:12:32,049 --> 01:12:34,255
Get off of me! Lt's this fuckin'...

999
01:12:34,384 --> 01:12:37,384
- All right, see you guys later.
- All right. Take it easy, Bill.

1000
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:41,761
So, Skylar, thanks for comin' by.

1001
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,847
Changed my opinion of Harvard people.

1002
01:12:43,975 --> 01:12:47,142
Ah, well, you don't want to rush the judgment on
that one 'cause, you know, they're not all like me.

1003
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:50,021
Oh, well, I'm sure.
But it was nice to meet ya.

1004
01:12:51,357 --> 01:12:52,851
- Take it easy.
- Oh, all right.

1005
01:12:52,983 --> 01:12:55,521
- Slowly back away.
- Oh, come on. Hey. Brother.

1006
01:12:55,652 --> 01:12:58,855
I don't know what you're doin', dude.
You're givin' us a ride.

1007
01:12:58,988 --> 01:13:01,146
- What the fuck do I look like to you?
- Come on, Chuck.

1008
01:13:01,282 --> 01:13:03,357
Else you're walkin', bitch.
WilI's takin' the car.

1009
01:13:04,576 --> 01:13:06,615
All right. Thanks, Chuck.
I appreciate it.

1010
01:13:06,745 --> 01:13:09,531
Wait, wait. I don't know what
you're gettin' all serious about.

1011
01:13:09,664 --> 01:13:11,537
You're droppin' me off first.

1012
01:13:11,665 --> 01:13:14,156
- Dude, it's really out of the way.
- Oh, okay.

1013
01:13:14,293 --> 01:13:16,581
- It's real far. - Just 'cause you have
to sleep in your one-room palace tonight...

1014
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:18,371
- don't start thinkin' you're bad.
- All right, come on.

1015
01:13:18,504 --> 01:13:20,746
Hey, wait a minute. You said
we were gonna see your place.

1016
01:13:20,881 --> 01:13:23,799
- No, not tonight.
- Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night, hon.

1017
01:13:23,926 --> 01:13:27,709
He knows once you see that little shit-hole,
he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.

1018
01:13:27,846 --> 01:13:29,885
But I wanted to meet
your brothers.

1019
01:13:30,014 --> 01:13:32,303
No. We're gonna do that another time.

1020
01:13:32,433 --> 01:13:34,306
All right.

1021
01:13:36,186 --> 01:13:38,593
Need them keys.

1022
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:42,644
The stewardess hears this and
goes haulin' ass down the aisle.

1023
01:13:42,775 --> 01:13:46,060
And I yell,
"Don't forget the coffee. "

1024
01:13:46,195 --> 01:13:48,899
No shit!
You didn't say that.

1025
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:51,023
- For Christ's sake, Marty, it's a joke.
- Yeah.

1026
01:13:51,157 --> 01:13:53,280
- I know someone that it actually happened to, Marty.
- A joke?

1027
01:13:53,409 --> 01:13:56,493
- Gerry. Have trouble findin' the place?
- Hi. No, I took a cab.

1028
01:13:56,620 --> 01:14:00,451
Timmy, this is Gerry.
We went to college together.

1029
01:14:00,582 --> 01:14:03,368
- How you doin'? Nice to meet ya.
- Pleased to meet ya.

1030
01:14:03,501 --> 01:14:07,201
- Can I get you a beer?
- Uh, no, just a Perrier.

1031
01:14:07,337 --> 01:14:09,164
That's French for club soda.

1032
01:14:09,297 --> 01:14:12,547
- Huh. Club soda, yeah.
- Yeah. A couple of sandwiches, too.

1033
01:14:12,675 --> 01:14:14,003
- Sure.
- Put it on my tab.

1034
01:14:14,135 --> 01:14:16,293
You ever plan on payin' your tab?

1035
01:14:16,428 --> 01:14:18,670
Yeah, chief. Got the winning
lottery ticket right here.

1036
01:14:18,805 --> 01:14:20,347
- What's the jackpot?
- $12 million.

1037
01:14:20,473 --> 01:14:25,182
- I don't think that'll cover it.
- Yeah, but it'll cover your sex change operation.

1038
01:14:28,438 --> 01:14:30,810
- Nuts?
- No, thank you.

1039
01:14:34,986 --> 01:14:37,856
So, you wanted to talk about Will.

1040
01:14:37,988 --> 01:14:40,526
- Well, it seems to be going well.
- I think so.

1041
01:14:43,493 --> 01:14:46,197
Have you talked to him at all
about his future?

1042
01:14:46,329 --> 01:14:49,863
No, we haven't gotten into that yet.
We're still bangin' away at the past.

1043
01:14:49,998 --> 01:14:53,533
Well, maybe you should. My phone's been
ringing off the hook with job offers.

1044
01:14:53,668 --> 01:14:57,499
- What kind?
- Well, cutting edge mathematics, think tanks.

1045
01:14:57,630 --> 01:15:00,963
The kind of place where a mind
like WilI's is given free rein.

1046
01:15:01,091 --> 01:15:03,629
That's, that's great
that there are offers...

1047
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,717
but I, I don't really think
he's ready for that.

1048
01:15:10,474 --> 01:15:12,597
I'm not sure you understand, Sean.

1049
01:15:14,019 --> 01:15:16,723
- Well, what don't I understand?
- Here you go, guys.

1050
01:15:16,854 --> 01:15:18,728
- Thanks, Tim.
- Yeah, thank you.

1051
01:15:18,856 --> 01:15:22,853
Just so you don't get
sticky fingers, huh?

1052
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:26,187
Tim, can you help us?
We're tryin' to settle a bet.

1053
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:27,601
Uh-oh.

1054
01:15:27,739 --> 01:15:31,154
- You ever heard of Jonas Salk?
- Sure. Cured polio.

1055
01:15:31,283 --> 01:15:33,904
- Ever heard of Albert Einstein?
- Hey.

1056
01:15:36,204 --> 01:15:39,407
How about Gerald Lambeau?
Ever heard of him?

1057
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:43,198
- No.
- Thank you, Tim.

1058
01:15:43,335 --> 01:15:45,208
- So, who won the bet?
- I did.

1059
01:15:48,715 --> 01:15:50,588
This isn't about me, Sean. I'm...

1060
01:15:52,509 --> 01:15:54,585
I'm nothing compared to this young man.

1061
01:15:58,181 --> 01:16:00,054
You ever hear of Gerald Lambeau?

1062
01:16:00,183 --> 01:16:03,183
In 1905 there were hundreds
of professors renown...

1063
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:06,097
for their study of the universe,
but it was a...

1064
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:09,396
It was a 26-year-old
Swiss patent clerk...

1065
01:16:09,524 --> 01:16:12,097
doing physics in his spare time
who changed the world.

1066
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:14,108
Can you imagine if Einstein
would have given that up...

1067
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,691
just to get drunk with his buddies
in Vienna every night?

1068
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:21,447
We all would've lost something.
Tim would never have heard of him.

1069
01:16:21,576 --> 01:16:24,611
- Pretty dramatic, Gerry.
- No, it isn't, Sean.

1070
01:16:24,745 --> 01:16:27,282
This boy has that gift.

1071
01:16:27,414 --> 01:16:29,869
He just hasn't got the direction,
but we can give that to him.

1072
01:16:29,999 --> 01:16:32,620
Hey, Gerry,
in the 1960s...

1073
01:16:32,752 --> 01:16:35,242
there was a young man graduated
from the University of Michigan.

1074
01:16:35,379 --> 01:16:38,582
Did some brilliant work in mathematics.

1075
01:16:38,715 --> 01:16:40,957
Specifically,
bounded harmonic functions.

1076
01:16:41,092 --> 01:16:43,131
Then he went on to Berkeley.
He was assistant professor.

1077
01:16:43,261 --> 01:16:47,210
Showed amazing potential. Then he moved to
Montana and he blew the competition away.

1078
01:16:47,347 --> 01:16:50,217
- Yeah, so who was he?
- Ted Kaczynski.

1079
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:52,141
Haven't heard of him.

1080
01:16:52,268 --> 01:16:53,679
- Hey, Timmy!
- Yo!

1081
01:16:53,811 --> 01:16:56,977
- Who's Ted Kaczynski?
- Unabomber.

1082
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:03,602
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
We gotta give this kid direction.

1083
01:17:03,736 --> 01:17:06,441
He can contribute to the world, and,
and we can help him do that.

1084
01:17:06,572 --> 01:17:09,276
- Direction's one thing. Manipulation's another, all right?
- Sean!

1085
01:17:09,408 --> 01:17:12,741
- We have to let him find...
- Sean, I'm not sitting at home every night twisting my mustache...

1086
01:17:12,869 --> 01:17:15,786
and hatching a, hatching a plan
to ruin this boy's life.

1087
01:17:15,913 --> 01:17:18,830
I was doing advanced mathematics
when I was, when I was 18...

1088
01:17:18,957 --> 01:17:21,827
and it still took me over 20 years to do
something worthy of a Field's medal.

1089
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,833
Well, maybe he doesn't want
what you want.

1090
01:17:23,962 --> 01:17:26,666
There's more to life
than a fuckin' Field's medal.

1091
01:17:26,797 --> 01:17:30,629
This is too important, Sean,
and it's above personal rivalry.

1092
01:17:30,759 --> 01:17:32,917
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Gerry.
Let's talk about the boy.

1093
01:17:33,053 --> 01:17:36,006
Why don't we give him time
to figure out what he wants?

1094
01:17:36,139 --> 01:17:39,341
That's a wonderful theory, Sean.
It worked wonders for you, didn't it?

1095
01:17:39,475 --> 01:17:42,012
Yeah, it did,
you arrogant fuckin' prick.

1096
01:17:43,561 --> 01:17:46,847
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I came here today.

1097
01:17:46,981 --> 01:17:49,104
I came here out of courtesy.
I- I wanted to keep you in the loop.

1098
01:17:49,233 --> 01:17:51,309
Oh, nice to be in the loop.

1099
01:17:51,443 --> 01:17:54,977
The boy's in a meeting right now
I set up for him over at McNeil.

1100
01:17:55,113 --> 01:17:59,110
Well, Will, uh, I'm not
exactly sure what you mean.

1101
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:01,115
We've already offered you
a position.

1102
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:03,531
Nobody in this town works
without a retainer, guys.

1103
01:18:03,662 --> 01:18:07,113
You think you can find somebody who does,
let me tell you, you have my blessin'.

1104
01:18:07,248 --> 01:18:10,414
But I think we all know that person's
not gonna represent you as well as I can.

1105
01:18:10,543 --> 01:18:13,662
Will, our offer
i- is $84,000 a year plus...

1106
01:18:13,795 --> 01:18:18,706
Retainer
Retainer.

1107
01:18:18,841 --> 01:18:21,462
You want us to give you cash
right now?

1108
01:18:21,594 --> 01:18:25,638
Whoa-ho-ho. Go easy.
Now, I didn't say that.

1109
01:18:25,764 --> 01:18:30,888
Allegedly, your situation, for you...

1110
01:18:31,018 --> 01:18:33,224
would be concurrently improved...

1111
01:18:33,353 --> 01:18:37,101
if I had $200
in my back pocket right now.

1112
01:18:38,524 --> 01:18:42,687
Well, I don't think I-I can, uh, uh...
Larry?

1113
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:46,983
- I've got $73.
- Uh, will you take a cheque?

1114
01:18:48,533 --> 01:18:51,736
Let me tell you somethin'.
You're suspect.

1115
01:18:51,869 --> 01:18:54,027
Yeah, you.

1116
01:18:54,163 --> 01:18:58,326
I don't know what your reputation is
in this town...

1117
01:18:58,458 --> 01:19:02,704
but after the shit you tried to pull
today, you can bet I'll be lookin' into you.

1118
01:19:02,837 --> 01:19:07,747
Now, any business
we have heretofore...

1119
01:19:07,883 --> 01:19:10,420
you can speak with
my aforementioned attorney.

1120
01:19:11,677 --> 01:19:15,591
Good day, gentlemen.
And until that day comes...

1121
01:19:15,723 --> 01:19:17,596
keep your ear to the grindstone.

1122
01:19:31,861 --> 01:19:33,770
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

1123
01:19:33,905 --> 01:19:35,980
Yeah.

1124
01:19:36,115 --> 01:19:38,949
Good.

1125
01:19:39,076 --> 01:19:42,111
- You want some help?
- No.

1126
01:19:42,245 --> 01:19:44,949
- Come on. Give me one little peek, we'll go to the batting cages.
- No.

1127
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:50,867
It is actually important
that I learn this.

1128
01:19:51,002 --> 01:19:54,786
- It's really important to me. Okay?
- All right. All right.

1129
01:19:56,924 --> 01:19:59,794
- So, why don't we just hang out here all day?
- Yes, why don't we?

1130
01:20:02,178 --> 01:20:05,761
All right, Mr Nosey Parker.

1131
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:10,266
Seeing as you're intent
on breaking my balls...

1132
01:20:10,394 --> 01:20:12,267
let me ask you a question.

1133
01:20:12,395 --> 01:20:14,471
All right.

1134
01:20:14,606 --> 01:20:18,437
Do you have a photographic memory?

1135
01:20:18,567 --> 01:20:20,441
I don't know.
I just kinda remember, you know?

1136
01:20:20,569 --> 01:20:24,068
I mean, how do you remember your
phone number? You know? You just do.

1137
01:20:24,197 --> 01:20:27,150
- Well, have you studied organic chemistry?
- A little bit.

1138
01:20:27,283 --> 01:20:29,987
- Oh, just for fun?
- Yeah, for kicks.

1139
01:20:30,119 --> 01:20:32,905
Yeah, it's so much fun
studying organic chemistry.

1140
01:20:33,038 --> 01:20:35,575
Are you mad?

1141
01:20:35,707 --> 01:20:39,834
Have you completely lost your mind?
Nobody studies it for fun.

1142
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,996
It's not a, a necessity,
especially for someone like you.

1143
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:45,371
- Someone like me?
- Yeah.

1144
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:49,634
Someone who divides their time fairly
evenly between batting cages and bars.

1145
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,669
I mean, I would hardly say
it was a necessity.

1146
01:20:51,804 --> 01:20:53,179
Oh.

1147
01:20:54,556 --> 01:20:57,343
You know, there are very smart people
here at Harvard.

1148
01:20:57,475 --> 01:21:01,342
And even they have to study,
because this is really hard.

1149
01:21:01,478 --> 01:21:05,226
And yet, you do it so easily.

1150
01:21:05,357 --> 01:21:08,855
I don't understand. I, I, I don't
understand how your mind works.

1151
01:21:08,985 --> 01:21:11,689
- Do you play the piano?
- I want to talk about this.

1152
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:13,860
No, I'm trying to explain it to you.
Do you play the piano?

1153
01:21:13,989 --> 01:21:18,366
- Yeah, a bit.
- All right. So when you, when you look at a piano, you see Mozart.

1154
01:21:18,493 --> 01:21:22,027
- I see "Chopsticks. "
- All right. Well, Beethoven, okay?

1155
01:21:22,163 --> 01:21:25,994
He looked at a piano, and it just
made sense to him. He could just play.

1156
01:21:26,124 --> 01:21:28,413
- So, what are you saying? You play the piano?
- No, not a lick.

1157
01:21:28,543 --> 01:21:32,374
I mean, I look at a piano, I see a bunch
of keys, three pedals and a box of wood.

1158
01:21:32,505 --> 01:21:37,213
But Beethoven, Mozart,
they saw it, they could just play.

1159
01:21:37,342 --> 01:21:40,960
I couldn't paint you a picture. I
probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway.

1160
01:21:41,095 --> 01:21:42,969
And I can't play the piano.

1161
01:21:43,097 --> 01:21:46,761
But you can do my O-chem paper
in under an hour.

1162
01:21:46,892 --> 01:21:48,967
Right. Well, I mean, when it came
to stuff like that...

1163
01:21:49,102 --> 01:21:51,059
I could always just play.

1164
01:21:53,814 --> 01:21:55,723
That's the best I can explain it.

1165
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:59,687
- Come here. I have to tell you something.
- Huh?

1166
01:21:59,819 --> 01:22:02,524
- I have to tell you something.
- Oh.

1167
01:22:02,655 --> 01:22:04,731
Well...

1168
01:22:19,169 --> 01:22:23,747
- It's not fair.
- What's not fair? What?

1169
01:22:23,881 --> 01:22:26,917
I've been here for four years...

1170
01:22:27,051 --> 01:22:29,755
and I've only just found you.

1171
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:32,920
Well, you found me.

1172
01:22:44,774 --> 01:22:46,813
Are you awake?

1173
01:22:46,942 --> 01:22:48,899
Nope.

1174
01:22:49,862 --> 01:22:51,901
Yes, you are.

1175
01:22:54,907 --> 01:22:58,027
Will, come to California with me.

1176
01:22:59,661 --> 01:23:01,535
What?

1177
01:23:03,581 --> 01:23:06,333
I want you to come to California
with me.

1178
01:23:11,588 --> 01:23:13,462
You sure about that?

1179
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:16,127
Oh, yeah.

1180
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:19,295
Yeah, but how do you know?

1181
01:23:19,428 --> 01:23:23,342
I don't know.
I just know.

1182
01:23:23,473 --> 01:23:26,343
Yeah, but h-how do you know?

1183
01:23:26,476 --> 01:23:31,552
I know because I feel it.

1184
01:23:31,688 --> 01:23:34,261
- 'Cause that's a really serious thing you're sayin'. I mean...
- I, I know.

1185
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:36,854
You could be in California next week,
and you know...

1186
01:23:36,985 --> 01:23:40,483
you might find out something about me
you don't like, and, you know...

1187
01:23:40,613 --> 01:23:43,613
maybe you wish you hadn't said that, but
you know it's such a serious thing...

1188
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:46,148
that you can't take it back,
and now I'm stuck in California...

1189
01:23:46,284 --> 01:23:49,071
with someone that doesn't really want to
be with me, just wish they had a take-back.

1190
01:23:49,203 --> 01:23:52,536
A what? What's a take-back?

1191
01:23:52,665 --> 01:23:54,989
I don't want a take-back.

1192
01:23:55,125 --> 01:23:58,707
I just want you to come
to California with me.

1193
01:23:58,836 --> 01:24:02,169
Well, I can't go to California
with you, so...

1194
01:24:04,633 --> 01:24:09,627
- Why not?
- Well, one, because I, I, I got a job here.

1195
01:24:09,762 --> 01:24:12,253
And two, because I live here.

1196
01:24:12,389 --> 01:24:16,339
Look, um, if you don't love me,
you should just tell me because...

1197
01:24:16,476 --> 01:24:19,477
I'm not sayin' I don't love you.

1198
01:24:19,604 --> 01:24:24,846
Then why? Why won't you come?
What are you so scared of?

1199
01:24:24,983 --> 01:24:26,940
What am I so scared of?

1200
01:24:27,069 --> 01:24:30,484
Well, what aren't you scared of?

1201
01:24:30,613 --> 01:24:34,397
You live in this safe little world where no one challenges
you, and you're scared shitless to do anything else.

1202
01:24:34,533 --> 01:24:37,569
- Because that might mean that you'd have to change.
- Don't, don't tell me about my world. Don't tell me about my world.

1203
01:24:37,703 --> 01:24:39,944
I mean, you just wanna have your little fling
with like the guy from the other side of town.

1204
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:43,080
Then you're gonna go off to Stanford.
You're gonna marry some rich prick...

1205
01:24:43,207 --> 01:24:45,199
who your parents will approve of,
and just sit around...

1206
01:24:45,334 --> 01:24:48,916
with the other trust-fund babies and talk
about how you went slummin', too, once.

1207
01:24:49,045 --> 01:24:51,962
Why are you saying this?

1208
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:54,627
What is your obsession with this money?

1209
01:24:54,759 --> 01:24:59,219
My father died when I was 13,
and I inherited this money.

1210
01:24:59,346 --> 01:25:04,684
You don't think every day I wake up,
and I wish I could give it back.

1211
01:25:04,809 --> 01:25:06,718
That I would give it back in a second...

1212
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:09,390
if it meant I could have one more day
with him, but I can't.

1213
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:11,597
And that's my life,
and I deal with it.

1214
01:25:11,731 --> 01:25:14,851
So don't put your shit on me
when you're the one that's afraid.

1215
01:25:14,984 --> 01:25:17,605
I'm afraid? W-W-What am I afraid of?
So, what the fuck am I afraid of?

1216
01:25:17,736 --> 01:25:20,227
You're afraid of me. You're afraid
that I won't love you back.

1217
01:25:20,364 --> 01:25:22,652
And you know what?
I'm afraid, too!

1218
01:25:22,782 --> 01:25:25,902
But fuck it, I wanna give it a shot.
And at least I'm honest with you.

1219
01:25:26,035 --> 01:25:29,949
- I'm not honest with you?
- No. What about your 12 brothers?

1220
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,989
All right.

1221
01:25:32,123 --> 01:25:34,281
No, you're not going.
You're not leaving.

1222
01:25:34,417 --> 01:25:37,252
What do you wanna know? What?
That I don't have 12 brothers?

1223
01:25:37,378 --> 01:25:39,750
- That I'm a fuckin' orphan? No, you don't wanna hear that.
- I didn't know that. I didn't know that.

1224
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:43,498
No, you don't wanna hear that. You don't wanna hear that I
got fuckin' cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid.

1225
01:25:43,633 --> 01:25:45,756
- Honey, I didn't know that.
- That this isn't fuckin' surgery.

1226
01:25:45,885 --> 01:25:49,254
That the motherfucker stabbed me.
You don't wanna hear that shit, Skylar!

1227
01:25:49,388 --> 01:25:51,879
- I do wanna hear that.
- Don't tell me you wanna hear that shit!

1228
01:25:52,015 --> 01:25:55,099
- I wanna hear it because I wanna help you, because I wanna be with you.
- Help me? What the fuck!

1229
01:25:55,226 --> 01:25:57,931
What do I got, a fuckin' sign
on my back that says, "Save me"?

1230
01:25:58,062 --> 01:25:59,520
- No.
- Do I look like I need that?

1231
01:25:59,647 --> 01:26:03,560
- No! God, I just want to be with you because I love you.
- Don't bullshit me. Don't bullshit me.

1232
01:26:03,692 --> 01:26:06,526
- Don't you fuckin' bullshit me!
- I love you. I love you.

1233
01:26:06,653 --> 01:26:09,108
I love you.

1234
01:26:10,447 --> 01:26:14,445
I wanna hear you say
that you don't love me.

1235
01:26:14,576 --> 01:26:16,615
Because if you say that...

1236
01:26:18,454 --> 01:26:20,493
then I won't call you...

1237
01:26:21,874 --> 01:26:24,910
and I won't be in your life.

1238
01:26:31,382 --> 01:26:33,623
I don't love you.

1239
01:26:37,512 --> 01:26:39,385
You don't...

1240
01:27:13,626 --> 01:27:17,670
Most people never get to see
how brilliant they can be.

1241
01:27:17,796 --> 01:27:20,500
They don't find teachers
that believe in them.

1242
01:27:20,632 --> 01:27:24,166
They get convinced they're stupid.

1243
01:27:24,301 --> 01:27:27,218
I hope you appreciate
what he's doing...

1244
01:27:27,346 --> 01:27:30,631
because I've seen how much
he enjoys working with you...

1245
01:27:30,765 --> 01:27:32,971
not against you.

1246
01:27:36,854 --> 01:27:38,727
Hello, Will.

1247
01:27:39,731 --> 01:27:41,973
Tom, can you get us some coffee?

1248
01:27:42,108 --> 01:27:43,982
Sure.

1249
01:27:47,529 --> 01:27:49,438
Now, let's see.

1250
01:27:55,494 --> 01:27:58,697
Good. This is correct.

1251
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:02,578
I see you used Maclaurin here.

1252
01:28:02,709 --> 01:28:05,828
Yeah, I don't know what
you call it, but...

1253
01:28:06,837 --> 01:28:09,209
This can't be right.

1254
01:28:11,675 --> 01:28:14,165
This would be very embarrassing.

1255
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:20,217
- Did you ever consider...
- I'm pretty sure it's right.

1256
01:28:20,349 --> 01:28:22,222
Hey, look, can we do this
at Sean's office from now on?

1257
01:28:22,350 --> 01:28:26,644
Because I, I gotta knock off work to
come here and the commute is killing me.

1258
01:28:26,771 --> 01:28:28,146
Yeah, sure.

1259
01:28:28,272 --> 01:28:30,348
- But did you think of the possibility...
- It's right.

1260
01:28:31,525 --> 01:28:35,522
It's right.
Just take it home with you.

1261
01:28:38,823 --> 01:28:40,732
What happened at the McNeil meeting?

1262
01:28:41,825 --> 01:28:46,036
I couldn't go. I had a date.
So, uh, so I sent my chief negotiator.

1263
01:28:49,874 --> 01:28:53,408
On your own time, you can do
whatever you like, Will.

1264
01:28:53,543 --> 01:28:56,248
But when I set up a meeting with,
with my associates...

1265
01:28:56,379 --> 01:28:58,834
and you don't show up,
it reflects poorly on me.

1266
01:28:58,965 --> 01:29:01,253
- Well, then don't set up any more meetings.
- Well, I won't.

1267
01:29:01,383 --> 01:29:03,708
I'll cancel them.

1268
01:29:03,844 --> 01:29:07,378
I'll give you a job myself. I, I just
wanted you to see what was out there.

1269
01:29:07,513 --> 01:29:10,680
Look, maybe I don't wanna spend the, the rest of my
fuckin' life sittin' around explaining shit to people.

1270
01:29:18,314 --> 01:29:21,268
I think you could show me
some appreciation.

1271
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:24,484
A little appreciation? Do you know
how easy this is for me?

1272
01:29:24,611 --> 01:29:27,777
Do you have any fuckin' idea how easy
this is? This is a fuckin' joke.

1273
01:29:27,906 --> 01:29:29,779
And I'm sorry you can't do this.
I really am.

1274
01:29:29,907 --> 01:29:32,445
Because I wouldn't have to fuckin'
sit here and watch you fumble around...

1275
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:34,485
and fuck it up.

1276
01:29:39,249 --> 01:29:42,866
Then you'd have more time to sit around
and get drunk instead, wouldn't you?

1277
01:29:43,002 --> 01:29:47,544
You're right. This is probably
a total waste of my time.

1278
01:30:01,684 --> 01:30:03,807
Yeah, you're right, Will.

1279
01:30:05,979 --> 01:30:08,648
I can't do this proof.

1280
01:30:10,275 --> 01:30:13,477
But you can. And when it comes to that,
it's only about...

1281
01:30:13,611 --> 01:30:16,944
It's just a handful of people in the world
who can tell the difference between you and me.

1282
01:30:17,072 --> 01:30:19,148
- But I'm one of 'em.
- Sorry.

1283
01:30:19,282 --> 01:30:21,440
Yeah, so am I.

1284
01:30:22,368 --> 01:30:24,740
Most days I wish I never met you...

1285
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:29,329
because then I could sleep at night.

1286
01:30:29,458 --> 01:30:32,328
And I didn't, I didn't have to walk
around with the knowledge...

1287
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:35,377
that there was someone like you
out there.

1288
01:30:41,509 --> 01:30:44,960
I- I didn't have to watch you
throw it all away.

1289
01:30:52,185 --> 01:30:54,510
Bill, hold it.

1290
01:30:54,646 --> 01:30:56,852
Did you hear that?

1291
01:30:57,773 --> 01:30:59,647
Morgan!

1292
01:30:59,775 --> 01:31:02,312
If you're watchin' pornos
in my mom's room again...

1293
01:31:02,444 --> 01:31:04,519
I'm gonna give you a fuckin' beatin'.

1294
01:31:21,126 --> 01:31:24,080
What's up, fellas?

1295
01:31:24,212 --> 01:31:27,166
Morgan, dude, why don't you jerk off
in your own fuckin' house, dude?

1296
01:31:27,298 --> 01:31:31,544
- That's fuckin' filthy.
- I don't got a V.C.R. At my house.

1297
01:31:31,677 --> 01:31:35,544
- You're kiddin'.
- Come on. Not in my glove.

1298
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:38,052
I didn't, I didn't use the glove.

1299
01:31:38,182 --> 01:31:40,056
That's my Little League glove.

1300
01:31:42,394 --> 01:31:45,099
What do you want me to do?

1301
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:47,388
I mean, what's wrong with you?

1302
01:31:47,523 --> 01:31:49,563
You'll hump a baseball glove?

1303
01:31:49,692 --> 01:31:53,060
I didn't. I didn't.
I just used it for the, for cleanup.

1304
01:31:54,154 --> 01:31:56,727
Will you stop jerkin' off
in my mother's room, please?

1305
01:31:56,865 --> 01:32:00,067
- Is there another V.C.R. In the house?
- It's just sad, bro.

1306
01:32:01,911 --> 01:32:06,536
So why do you think I should work
for the National Security Agency?

1307
01:32:06,665 --> 01:32:09,867
Well, you'd be working
on the cutting edge.

1308
01:32:10,001 --> 01:32:13,001
You'd be exposed to the kind of technology
that you wouldn't see anywhere else...

1309
01:32:13,128 --> 01:32:15,915
because we've classified it.

1310
01:32:16,048 --> 01:32:19,582
Superstring theory,
chaos math, advanced algorithms.

1311
01:32:19,717 --> 01:32:22,718
Code breaking.

1312
01:32:22,845 --> 01:32:25,466
Well, that's one aspect
of what we do.

1313
01:32:25,597 --> 01:32:27,471
Oh, come on.
I mean, that is what you do.

1314
01:32:27,599 --> 01:32:30,635
You guys handle 80%
of the intelligence workload.

1315
01:32:30,768 --> 01:32:33,259
You're seven times the size
of the C.I.A.

1316
01:32:33,396 --> 01:32:36,431
We don't like to brag
about that, Will.

1317
01:32:36,565 --> 01:32:39,731
But you're exactly right.

1318
01:32:39,859 --> 01:32:43,062
So, the way I see it,
the question isn't...

1319
01:32:43,195 --> 01:32:45,768
"Why should you work for the N.S.A.?"

1320
01:32:45,906 --> 01:32:48,444
The question is:
"Why shouldn't you?"

1321
01:32:48,575 --> 01:32:52,323
Why shouldn't I work for the N.S.A.?

1322
01:32:52,453 --> 01:32:56,402
That's a tough one,
but I'll take a shot.

1323
01:32:56,540 --> 01:32:58,947
Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.
And somebody puts a code on my desk.

1324
01:32:59,084 --> 01:33:00,957
Somethin' no one else can break.

1325
01:33:01,086 --> 01:33:03,042
Maybe I take a shot at it,
and maybe I break it.

1326
01:33:03,171 --> 01:33:05,329
And I'm real happy with myself
'cause I did my job well.

1327
01:33:05,464 --> 01:33:08,915
But maybe that code was the location of some
rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East.

1328
01:33:09,051 --> 01:33:12,419
And once they have that location, they bomb
the village where the rebels are hidin'.

1329
01:33:12,554 --> 01:33:16,764
Fifteen hundred people that I never met,
never had no problem with, get killed.

1330
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:19,891
Now the politicians are sayin', "Oh,
send in the marines to secure the area. "

1331
01:33:20,018 --> 01:33:22,556
'Cause they don't give a shit. It won't
be their kid over there gettin' shot.

1332
01:33:22,687 --> 01:33:24,561
Just like it wasn't them
when their number got called...

1333
01:33:24,689 --> 01:33:26,811
'cause they were all pullin' a tour
in the National Guard.

1334
01:33:26,941 --> 01:33:29,775
It'll be some kid from Southie
over there takin' shrapnel in the ass.

1335
01:33:29,902 --> 01:33:31,977
He comes back to find that the plant
he used to work at...

1336
01:33:32,112 --> 01:33:34,484
got exported to the country
he just got back from...

1337
01:33:34,614 --> 01:33:36,736
and the guy who put the shrapnel
in his ass got his old job...

1338
01:33:36,866 --> 01:33:39,783
'cause he'll work for 15 cents a day
and no bathroom breaks.

1339
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:42,317
Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason
he was over there in the first place...

1340
01:33:42,454 --> 01:33:45,490
was so that we could install a government
that would sell us oil at a good price.

1341
01:33:45,623 --> 01:33:49,407
And, of course, the oil companies used a little
skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices.

1342
01:33:49,543 --> 01:33:51,417
A cute little ancillary benefit
for them...

1343
01:33:51,545 --> 01:33:54,035
but it ain't helpin' my buddy
at $2.50 a gallon.

1344
01:33:54,172 --> 01:33:56,164
They're takin' their sweet time
bringin' the oil back, of course.

1345
01:33:56,299 --> 01:33:58,505
Maybe they even took the liberty
of hirin' an alcoholic skipper...

1346
01:33:58,634 --> 01:34:01,800
who likes to drink martinis and
fuckin' play slalom with the icebergs.

1347
01:34:01,929 --> 01:34:04,004
It ain't too long till he hits one,
spills the oil...

1348
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:06,676
and kills all the sea life
in the North Atlantic.

1349
01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:08,966
So now by buddy's out of work.
He can't afford to drive...

1350
01:34:09,101 --> 01:34:11,177
so he's walkin' to the fuckin'
job interviews, which sucks...

1351
01:34:11,311 --> 01:34:13,932
because the shrapnel in his ass
is givin' him chronic haemorrhoids.

1352
01:34:14,064 --> 01:34:16,471
And meanwhile, he's starvin' 'cause every
time he tries to get a bite to eat...

1353
01:34:16,608 --> 01:34:21,483
the only blue plate special they're servin'
is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.

1354
01:34:21,612 --> 01:34:23,485
So what did I think?

1355
01:34:23,614 --> 01:34:27,112
I'm holdin' out for something better.

1356
01:34:27,242 --> 01:34:30,444
I figure, fuck it. While I'm at it,
why not just shoot my buddy...

1357
01:34:30,578 --> 01:34:32,451
take his job,
give it to his sworn enemy...

1358
01:34:32,579 --> 01:34:35,035
hike up gas prices, bomb a village,
club a baby seal...

1359
01:34:35,165 --> 01:34:37,869
hit the hash pipe
and join the National Guard?

1360
01:34:38,001 --> 01:34:40,538
I can be elected president.

1361
01:34:40,670 --> 01:34:43,872
- You feel like you're alone, Will?
- What?

1362
01:34:44,965 --> 01:34:47,372
Do you have a soul mate?

1363
01:34:47,509 --> 01:34:50,178
Do I have a...
Define that.

1364
01:34:50,303 --> 01:34:52,212
Somebody who challenges you.

1365
01:34:53,347 --> 01:34:55,256
- Uh, Chuckie.
- No, Chuckie's family.

1366
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:57,963
He'd lie down
in fuckin' traffic for you.

1367
01:34:58,101 --> 01:35:01,600
No, I'm talkin' about someone who opens
up things for you, touches your soul.

1368
01:35:03,897 --> 01:35:07,231
- I got... I got...
- Who?

1369
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:10,028
- I got plenty.
- Well, name 'em.

1370
01:35:10,153 --> 01:35:13,355
Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,
O'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke...

1371
01:35:13,489 --> 01:35:16,406
- That's great. They're all dead.
- Not to me they're not.

1372
01:35:16,533 --> 01:35:18,822
Nah. You don't have
a lot of dialogue with them.

1373
01:35:20,161 --> 01:35:22,035
You can't give back to them, Will.

1374
01:35:22,163 --> 01:35:24,570
Not without some serious smelling salts
and a heater.

1375
01:35:24,707 --> 01:35:26,746
Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1376
01:35:28,210 --> 01:35:30,332
You'll never have that kind
of relationship in a world...

1377
01:35:30,462 --> 01:35:32,668
where you're always afraid
to take the first step...

1378
01:35:32,797 --> 01:35:36,296
because all you see is every
negative thing ten miles down the road.

1379
01:35:36,425 --> 01:35:38,832
- You gonna take the professor's side on this?
- Don't give me a line of shit.

1380
01:35:38,969 --> 01:35:40,344
- No.
- Look, I didn't want the job.

1381
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:42,877
It's not about the job. I don't care
if you work for the government.

1382
01:35:43,014 --> 01:35:46,098
But you can do anything you want.
You are bound by nothing.

1383
01:35:47,601 --> 01:35:51,100
What are you passionate about?
What do you want?

1384
01:35:51,229 --> 01:35:53,352
I mean, there are guys who work
their entire life layin' brick...

1385
01:35:53,481 --> 01:35:55,936
so their kids have a chance
at the opportunities you have here.

1386
01:35:56,067 --> 01:35:58,522
- I didn't ask for this.
- No.

1387
01:35:58,652 --> 01:36:01,059
You were born with it, so don't cop out
behind, "I didn't ask for this. "

1388
01:36:01,196 --> 01:36:04,529
What do you mean, "cop out"? I mean,
w- w-what's wrong with layin' brick?

1389
01:36:04,657 --> 01:36:07,408
- Nothin'.
- There's nothin' wrong with it. That's, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'.

1390
01:36:07,535 --> 01:36:12,243
Right. My day laid brick, okay? Busted
his ass so I could have an education.

1391
01:36:12,372 --> 01:36:15,871
Exactly. That's an honourable profession.
What's wrong with, with fixin' somebody's car?

1392
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,455
Someone will get to work the next day
because of me. There's honour in that.

1393
01:36:18,586 --> 01:36:20,744
Yeah, there is, Will. There's honour
in that. And there's honour in...

1394
01:36:20,879 --> 01:36:22,871
you know, taking that
40-minute train ride...

1395
01:36:23,006 --> 01:36:25,461
so those college kids could come in
in the morning and the floors are clean.

1396
01:36:25,591 --> 01:36:27,299
And the wastebaskets are empty.
That's real work.

1397
01:36:27,426 --> 01:36:29,751
- That's right.
- Right. And that's honourable.

1398
01:36:29,887 --> 01:36:33,587
Sure, that's why you took that job.
I mean, for the honour of it.

1399
01:36:33,723 --> 01:36:35,632
I just have a little question here.

1400
01:36:35,767 --> 01:36:38,436
You could be a janitor anywhere.

1401
01:36:38,561 --> 01:36:42,225
Why did you work at the most prestigious
technical college in the whole fuckin' world?

1402
01:36:42,356 --> 01:36:45,605
And why did you sneak around at night
and finish other people's formulas...

1403
01:36:45,733 --> 01:36:49,600
that only one or two people in the world
could do, and then lie about it?

1404
01:36:52,281 --> 01:36:54,605
'Cause I don't see a lot of honour
in that, Will.

1405
01:36:57,910 --> 01:37:00,235
So what do you really want to do?

1406
01:37:04,458 --> 01:37:07,411
- I wanna be a shepherd.
- Really?

1407
01:37:07,543 --> 01:37:09,750
I wanna move up to Nashua,
get a nice little spread...

1408
01:37:09,879 --> 01:37:11,788
get some sheep
and tend to them.

1409
01:37:11,922 --> 01:37:14,792
- Maybe you should go do that.
- What?

1410
01:37:14,925 --> 01:37:17,629
You know, if you're gonna jerk off, why don't
you just do it at home with a moist towel?

1411
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,302
- You're chuckin' me?
- Yeah, get the fuck outta here.

1412
01:37:19,429 --> 01:37:21,337
- Hey, no, no, no. Time's not up yet.
- Yeah, it is.

1413
01:37:21,472 --> 01:37:23,713
- I'm not leavin'. No.
- Listen, you're not gonna answer my questions.

1414
01:37:23,849 --> 01:37:26,684
- You're wastin' my fuckin' time.
- What? I thought we were friends. What do you mean, you...

1415
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:30,344
- Playtime's over, okay?
- Well, why you kickin' me out, Sean? I mean, what... I mean...

1416
01:37:30,479 --> 01:37:33,813
You're lecturin' me on life?
Look at you, you fuckin' burnout.

1417
01:37:33,941 --> 01:37:36,099
- What winds your clock?
- Workin' with you.

1418
01:37:36,234 --> 01:37:39,270
Where's your soul mate? You wanna talk
about soul mates? Where is she?

1419
01:37:39,404 --> 01:37:41,479
- Dead.
- That's right, she's fuckin' dead.

1420
01:37:41,614 --> 01:37:44,283
She fuckin' dies, and you just
cash in your chips and you walk away?

1421
01:37:44,408 --> 01:37:48,535
- Hey, at least I played a hand.
- Oh, and you played a hand and you lost. You lost a big fuckin' hand.

1422
01:37:48,661 --> 01:37:51,995
And some people will lose a big hand like
that and have the sack to ante up again.

1423
01:37:52,123 --> 01:37:55,207
Look at me.
What do you wanna do?

1424
01:38:02,256 --> 01:38:06,205
You and your bullshit. You got
a bullshit answer for everybody.

1425
01:38:06,343 --> 01:38:10,174
But I ask you a very simple question,
and you can't give me a straight answer.

1426
01:38:11,889 --> 01:38:14,214
Because you don't know.

1427
01:38:15,851 --> 01:38:18,057
See ya, Bo-Peep.

1428
01:38:21,147 --> 01:38:23,305
- Fuck you.
- You're the shepherd.

1429
01:38:28,028 --> 01:38:30,067
Shepherd.

1430
01:38:30,197 --> 01:38:32,272
White little prick.

1431
01:38:33,616 --> 01:38:35,490
I just wanted to, you know, um...

1432
01:38:35,618 --> 01:38:39,069
call you up, uh, before you left, um...

1433
01:38:39,204 --> 01:38:41,243
I've been takin' all these, uh,
job interviews and stuff...

1434
01:38:41,373 --> 01:38:43,495
so I'm not gonna be
just a construction worker.

1435
01:38:43,625 --> 01:38:46,495
Well, you know,
I never really cared about that.

1436
01:38:48,087 --> 01:38:49,960
Yeah.

1437
01:38:53,091 --> 01:38:54,466
I love you.

1438
01:38:59,805 --> 01:39:01,299
Will?

1439
01:39:02,849 --> 01:39:04,224
You take care.

1440
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:07,885
Someone's always comin'
around here

1441
01:39:08,020 --> 01:39:10,558
- Trailin' some new kill
- Bye.

1442
01:39:12,774 --> 01:39:14,850
Says I seen your picture

1443
01:39:14,984 --> 01:39:19,610
On a hundred dollar bill

1444
01:39:19,738 --> 01:39:23,818
What's a game of chance to you

1445
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:26,405
In this world

1446
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:31,494
Of real skill
So glad to meet you

1447
01:39:31,623 --> 01:39:36,000
Angeles

1448
01:39:37,795 --> 01:39:39,871
Pickin' up the ticket shows

1449
01:39:40,005 --> 01:39:43,705
There's money to be made

1450
01:39:45,593 --> 01:39:47,586
Go on, lose the gamble

1451
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:52,346
That's the history of the trade

1452
01:39:52,474 --> 01:39:57,764
Did you add up
all the cards left to play

1453
01:40:01,023 --> 01:40:04,972
To zero
And sign up with people

1454
01:40:05,110 --> 01:40:07,731
Angeles

1455
01:40:09,238 --> 01:40:12,773
Don't start with me tryin'

1456
01:40:15,202 --> 01:40:17,609
Will, come on.
Will!

1457
01:40:19,789 --> 01:40:22,030
Will, that's it.
We're done here.

1458
01:40:22,166 --> 01:40:25,166
I'm sitting in your office
and the boy isn't here.

1459
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:30,751
Well, it's ten past 5:00.
An hour and ten minutes late.

1460
01:40:30,882 --> 01:40:34,582
I can make you satisfied
in everything

1461
01:40:34,718 --> 01:40:36,841
Well, what if he doesn't show up
and I file a report...

1462
01:40:36,970 --> 01:40:38,844
saying he wasn't here
and he goes back to jail?

1463
01:40:38,972 --> 01:40:41,723
Lt won't be on my conscience.

1464
01:40:41,849 --> 01:40:44,803
Now becoming true

1465
01:40:44,935 --> 01:40:47,426
Okay. Fine.

1466
01:40:49,564 --> 01:40:51,438
What's up?

1467
01:40:53,359 --> 01:40:55,232
Thanks.

1468
01:41:00,115 --> 01:41:01,988
Fuck, that's good.

1469
01:41:05,661 --> 01:41:07,784
So how's your lady?

1470
01:41:07,913 --> 01:41:09,786
Ah, she's gone.

1471
01:41:11,082 --> 01:41:13,288
Gone? Gone where?

1472
01:41:13,418 --> 01:41:17,794
Uh, med school.
Medical school in California.

1473
01:41:17,921 --> 01:41:19,119
- Really?
- Yeah.

1474
01:41:19,256 --> 01:41:21,793
- When was this?
- It was like a week ago.

1475
01:41:26,679 --> 01:41:28,920
That sucks.

1476
01:41:31,433 --> 01:41:35,050
So, uh, when are you done
with those meetin's?

1477
01:41:35,186 --> 01:41:37,059
I think the week after I'm 21.

1478
01:41:37,188 --> 01:41:39,857
Yeah? They gonna hook you up
with a job or what?

1479
01:41:39,982 --> 01:41:44,193
Yeah. Fuckin' sit in a room and do
long division for the next 50 years.

1480
01:41:44,319 --> 01:41:47,652
Ah, probably make some nice bank though.

1481
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:49,653
I'm gonna be a fuckin' lab rat.

1482
01:41:49,782 --> 01:41:53,150
Better than this shit.
Way outta here.

1483
01:41:53,285 --> 01:41:55,111
Well, uh, what do I want a way
out of here for?

1484
01:41:55,245 --> 01:41:57,782
I mean, I'm gonna fuckin' live here
the rest of my life.

1485
01:41:57,913 --> 01:41:59,989
You know, be neighbours.
You know, have little kids.

1486
01:42:00,124 --> 01:42:02,994
Fuckin' take them to Little League
together up Foley Field.

1487
01:42:06,896 --> 01:42:09,351
Look, you're my best friend
so don't take this the wrong way...

1488
01:42:09,481 --> 01:42:13,229
but in 20 years,
if you're still livin' here...

1489
01:42:13,359 --> 01:42:16,562
comin' over to my house to watch the
Patriot's games, still workin' construction...

1490
01:42:16,695 --> 01:42:18,771
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

1491
01:42:18,906 --> 01:42:21,527
- That's not a threat. That's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill ya.
- What?

1492
01:42:21,658 --> 01:42:23,781
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

1493
01:42:23,910 --> 01:42:27,859
- Look, you got something none of us have.
- Oh, come on. W-Why is it always this?

1494
01:42:27,997 --> 01:42:31,081
I mean, I fuckin' owe it to myself to do
this or that. What if I don't want to?

1495
01:42:31,208 --> 01:42:35,205
Oh, no, no, no. No, fuck you.
You don't owe it to yourself.

1496
01:42:35,336 --> 01:42:37,494
You owe it to me...

1497
01:42:37,630 --> 01:42:40,120
'cause tomorrow I'm gonna wake up
and I'll be 50...

1498
01:42:40,257 --> 01:42:43,092
and I'll still be doin' this shit.

1499
01:42:43,218 --> 01:42:45,175
And that's all right. That's fine.

1500
01:42:45,303 --> 01:42:47,972
I mean, you're sittin' on
a winnin' lottery ticket.

1501
01:42:48,097 --> 01:42:51,797
And you're too much of a pussy
to cash it in, and that's bullshit.

1502
01:42:53,977 --> 01:42:56,646
'Cause I'd do fuckin' anything
to have what you got.

1503
01:42:56,771 --> 01:42:59,641
So would any of these fuckin' guys.

1504
01:42:59,773 --> 01:43:02,229
It'd be an insult to us
if you're still here in 20 years.

1505
01:43:02,359 --> 01:43:05,478
Hangin' around here
is a fuckin' waste of your time.

1506
01:43:05,612 --> 01:43:07,189
- You don't know that.
- I don't?

1507
01:43:07,322 --> 01:43:09,397
- No, you don't know that.
- Oh, I don't know that.

1508
01:43:09,532 --> 01:43:11,405
Let me tell you what I do know.

1509
01:43:11,533 --> 01:43:14,700
Every day I come by your house
and I pick you up.

1510
01:43:14,828 --> 01:43:18,825
And we go out and we have a few drinks
and a few laughs, and it's great.

1511
01:43:18,956 --> 01:43:21,577
You know what the best part
of my day is?

1512
01:43:21,709 --> 01:43:26,002
For about ten seconds, from when I pull
up to the kerb and when I get to your door.

1513
01:43:26,129 --> 01:43:28,168
'Cause I think maybe I'll get up there
and I'll knock on the door...

1514
01:43:28,298 --> 01:43:30,835
and you won't be there.

1515
01:43:30,966 --> 01:43:34,382
No "goodbye," no "see ya later. "
No nothin'. You just left.

1516
01:43:36,137 --> 01:43:39,755
I don't know much, but I know that.

1517
01:43:51,234 --> 01:43:53,440
This is a disaster, Sean.

1518
01:43:53,569 --> 01:43:56,142
I brought you in here because
I wanted you to help me with the boy.

1519
01:43:56,279 --> 01:43:58,355
- Not to run him out.
- I know what I'm doing with the boy, Gerry.

1520
01:43:58,490 --> 01:44:01,941
I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy! I
don't care if you have a few laughs, even at my expense.

1521
01:44:02,076 --> 01:44:04,614
But don't you dare undermine
what I'm trying to do here.

1522
01:44:04,745 --> 01:44:07,781
- Undermine?
- This boy is at a fragile point right now.

1523
01:44:07,914 --> 01:44:10,998
I do understand. He is at a fragile
point, okay? He's got problems.

1524
01:44:11,125 --> 01:44:14,624
Well, what problems does he have, Sean? That he's
better off as a janitor? That he's better off in jail?

1525
01:44:14,753 --> 01:44:17,670
Better off hanging out with a bunch
of retarded gorillas?

1526
01:44:17,798 --> 01:44:21,711
Oh, why do you think he does that, Gerry?
Do you have any fuckin' clue why? Hmm?

1527
01:44:21,843 --> 01:44:25,258
He can handle the problems. He can handle
the work, and he obviously handled you.

1528
01:44:25,387 --> 01:44:29,467
Gerry, listen to me. Listen. Why is he
hiding? Why doesn't he trust anybody?

1529
01:44:29,599 --> 01:44:32,968
Because the first thing that happened to him, he was
abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most.

1530
01:44:33,102 --> 01:44:35,474
- Oh, come on, don't give me that Freudian crap.
- Oh, no, listen, Gerry.

1531
01:44:35,604 --> 01:44:38,474
And why does he hang out with those
retarded gorillas, as you call them?

1532
01:44:38,607 --> 01:44:42,390
Because any one of them, if you asked them to,
would take a fuckin' bat to your head. Okay?

1533
01:44:42,527 --> 01:44:44,436
- That's called loyalty.
- Yeah, that's very touching.

1534
01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:48,519
And who is he handling? He pushes people
away before they have a chance to leave him.

1535
01:44:48,657 --> 01:44:51,148
It's a defence mechanism, all right?

1536
01:44:51,284 --> 01:44:53,822
And for 20 years he's been alone
because of that.

1537
01:44:53,953 --> 01:44:56,658
And if you push him right now, it's
gonna be the same thing all over again.

1538
01:44:56,789 --> 01:44:58,662
And I'm not gonna let
that happen to him.

1539
01:44:58,791 --> 01:45:00,450
- Now, don't you do that, Sean.
- What, Gerry?

1540
01:45:00,584 --> 01:45:03,454
Don't you do that. Don't infect him
with the idea that it's okay to quit.

1541
01:45:03,586 --> 01:45:06,503
That it's okay to be a failure,
because it's not okay, Sean.

1542
01:45:06,630 --> 01:45:10,213
And if you're angry at me for being, being
successful, for being what you could have been, Sean...

1543
01:45:10,342 --> 01:45:13,129
- I'm not angry at you, Gerry.
- Oh, yes, you're angry at me, Sean.

1544
01:45:13,261 --> 01:45:17,507
You resent me. But I'm not gonna
apologize for any, any success I've had.

1545
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:20,177
You're angry at me for doing what
you could have done.

1546
01:45:20,309 --> 01:45:24,555
But ask yourself, Sean. Ask yourself
if you want Will to feel that way.

1547
01:45:24,687 --> 01:45:27,972
- If you want him to feel like a failure.
- Oh, you arrogant shit!

1548
01:45:28,107 --> 01:45:30,680
That's why I don't come
to the goddam reunions.

1549
01:45:30,818 --> 01:45:32,691
'Cause I can't stand
that look in your eye.

1550
01:45:32,819 --> 01:45:35,689
- You know, that condescending embarrassed look?
- Oh, come on, Sean.

1551
01:45:35,822 --> 01:45:37,861
You think I'm a failure.
I know who I am.

1552
01:45:37,990 --> 01:45:40,907
And I'm proud of what I do.
It was a conscious choice.

1553
01:45:41,035 --> 01:45:42,742
I didn't fuck up.

1554
01:45:42,869 --> 01:45:45,158
And you and your cronies think
I'm some sort of pity case.

1555
01:45:45,288 --> 01:45:48,988
You and your kiss-ass chorus following you around
going, "The Field's medal! The Field's medal!"

1556
01:45:49,125 --> 01:45:52,209
Why are you still so fuckin' afraid
of failure?

1557
01:45:52,336 --> 01:45:56,036
It's about my medal, is it? Oh, God, I could
go home and get it for you. You can have it.

1558
01:45:56,172 --> 01:45:59,505
Oh, please don't. You know... You know what, Gerry?
Shove the medal up your fuckin' ass, all right?

1559
01:45:59,634 --> 01:46:03,713
'Cause I don't give a shit about your medal because
I knew you before you were a mathematical god.

1560
01:46:03,845 --> 01:46:07,380
When you were pimple-faced and homesick, and
didn't know what side of the bed to piss on.

1561
01:46:07,515 --> 01:46:09,306
Yeah, you were smarter than me then
and you're smarter than me now.

1562
01:46:09,433 --> 01:46:11,509
So don't blame me for how your life
turned out. It's not my fault.

1563
01:46:11,644 --> 01:46:15,557
I don't blame you. It's not about you,
you mathematical dick!

1564
01:46:15,689 --> 01:46:18,226
It's about the boy.
He's a good kid.

1565
01:46:18,358 --> 01:46:21,726
And I won't see you fuck him up like
you're trying to fuck up me right now.

1566
01:46:21,861 --> 01:46:24,434
I won't see you make him feel
like a failure, too.

1567
01:46:24,571 --> 01:46:27,406
- He won't be a failure, Sean!
- But, but if you push him, Gerry...

1568
01:46:27,532 --> 01:46:30,367
- If you ride him...
- Sean, I am what I am today...

1569
01:46:30,493 --> 01:46:33,743
because I was pushed and
because I learned to push myself.

1570
01:46:33,871 --> 01:46:36,243
He's not you! Do you get that?

1571
01:46:38,416 --> 01:46:41,417
- I can come back.
- No, come in. Uh...

1572
01:46:41,544 --> 01:46:43,951
I was just leaving.

1573
01:46:54,263 --> 01:46:57,928
A lot of that stuff goes back a long way
between me and him.

1574
01:46:58,058 --> 01:47:00,264
You know. Not about you.

1575
01:47:05,606 --> 01:47:08,891
- What is that?
- This is your file.

1576
01:47:09,025 --> 01:47:11,397
I have to send it back to the judge
for evaluation.

1577
01:47:11,528 --> 01:47:14,314
Oh.

1578
01:47:14,447 --> 01:47:16,605
Hey, you're not gonna fail me, are you?

1579
01:47:20,368 --> 01:47:22,242
What's it say?

1580
01:47:23,746 --> 01:47:25,785
- Wanna read it?
- Why?

1581
01:47:29,251 --> 01:47:31,457
Have you had any, uh, experience
with that?

1582
01:47:31,586 --> 01:47:35,120
Twenty years of counselling.
Yeah, I've seen some pretty awful shit.

1583
01:47:36,090 --> 01:47:39,505
I mean, have you had any experience
with that?

1584
01:47:43,555 --> 01:47:45,962
Personally?

1585
01:47:46,098 --> 01:47:48,091
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I have.

1586
01:47:49,726 --> 01:47:51,137
It sure ain't good.

1587
01:47:55,231 --> 01:47:59,643
My father was an alcoholic.
Mean, fuckin' drunk.

1588
01:48:01,194 --> 01:48:04,111
He'd come home hammered,
lookin' to whale on somebody.

1589
01:48:04,239 --> 01:48:07,690
So I'd provoke him so he wouldn't
go after my mother and little brother.

1590
01:48:09,702 --> 01:48:12,323
Interesting nights
were when he wore his rings.

1591
01:48:14,164 --> 01:48:17,615
Yeah, he used to just put
a, uh, a wrench...

1592
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:20,454
a stick and a belt
on the table...

1593
01:48:20,586 --> 01:48:22,874
and just say, "Choose. "

1594
01:48:23,005 --> 01:48:24,664
Well, I gotta go with the belt
there, then.

1595
01:48:24,798 --> 01:48:28,842
- I used to go with the wrench.
- Why the wrench?

1596
01:48:28,968 --> 01:48:31,044
'Cause fuck him, that's why.

1597
01:48:31,178 --> 01:48:34,511
- Your foster father?
- Yeah.

1598
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:39,633
So, uh, you know, what is it? Like Will has
an attachment disorder? Ls it all that stuff?

1599
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:43,843
Fear of abandonment?

1600
01:48:43,981 --> 01:48:47,183
Is that why, uh, is that why
I broke up with Skylar?

1601
01:48:47,317 --> 01:48:50,650
- I didn't know you had.
- Yeah, I did.

1602
01:48:50,778 --> 01:48:52,854
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

1603
01:48:56,866 --> 01:48:59,439
Hey, Will?

1604
01:48:59,577 --> 01:49:01,616
I don't know a lot.

1605
01:49:02,997 --> 01:49:06,080
But you see this?
All this shit?

1606
01:49:11,170 --> 01:49:13,079
This is not your fault.

1607
01:49:15,174 --> 01:49:17,545
Yeah, I know that.

1608
01:49:17,676 --> 01:49:19,549
Look at me, son.

1609
01:49:20,845 --> 01:49:23,170
It's not your fault.

1610
01:49:23,305 --> 01:49:27,717
- I know.
- No. It's not your fault.

1611
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:32,726
- I know.
- No, no, you don't.

1612
01:49:32,855 --> 01:49:35,061
It's not your fault.

1613
01:49:37,067 --> 01:49:38,858
- I know.
- It's not your fault.

1614
01:49:38,985 --> 01:49:42,021
- All right.
- It's not your fault.

1615
01:49:44,865 --> 01:49:46,739
It's not your fault.

1616
01:49:46,867 --> 01:49:48,776
Don't fuck with me.

1617
01:49:51,621 --> 01:49:54,408
- It's not your fault.
- Don't fuck with me. All right?

1618
01:49:54,540 --> 01:49:57,576
- Don't fuck with me, Sean. Not you.
- It's not your fault.

1619
01:50:06,884 --> 01:50:09,457
It's not your fault.

1620
01:50:14,474 --> 01:50:16,347
Oh, my God!

1621
01:50:17,559 --> 01:50:21,473
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Oh, God.

1622
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:38,067
Fuck them, okay?

1623
01:52:04,525 --> 01:52:06,850
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm, uh, Will Hunting.

1624
01:52:06,985 --> 01:52:10,769
- I'm here about a position.
- Could you just have a seat for a moment?

1625
01:52:14,658 --> 01:52:18,193
Yes, there's a Mr Hunting in the lobby.
He's here for his appointment.

1626
01:52:38,178 --> 01:52:40,217
Which one did you take?

1627
01:52:40,347 --> 01:52:45,091
I was over at, uh, McNeil. It's one of
the jobs the professor set me up with.

1628
01:52:45,226 --> 01:52:49,554
Uh, I haven't told him yet, but I went, I
went down there and I talked to my boss, and...

1629
01:52:49,688 --> 01:52:52,641
My new boss.
He seemed like a good guy.

1630
01:52:52,774 --> 01:52:55,727
Is that what you want?

1631
01:52:55,860 --> 01:52:58,564
Yeah, you know, I think so.

1632
01:52:58,695 --> 01:53:01,779
Well, good for you.
Congratulations.

1633
01:53:01,906 --> 01:53:03,780
Thanks.

1634
01:53:06,911 --> 01:53:08,784
Time's up.

1635
01:53:11,790 --> 01:53:14,909
So that's, so that's it?
So we're, we're done?

1636
01:53:15,043 --> 01:53:17,747
Yeah, that's it.

1637
01:53:17,878 --> 01:53:20,250
You're done. You're a free man.

1638
01:53:22,048 --> 01:53:26,674
Well, um, I just want you
to know, Sean, that...

1639
01:53:26,802 --> 01:53:28,676
You're welcome, Will.

1640
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:37,101
So, you know, I, I hope
we keep in touch, you know.

1641
01:53:37,228 --> 01:53:39,553
Yeah, me, too.

1642
01:53:39,688 --> 01:53:42,309
I'll be travelling around a bit,
and it'll be a little hard, but, uh...

1643
01:53:42,441 --> 01:53:46,105
I've got an answering machine at
the college I'll be checking in with.

1644
01:53:46,236 --> 01:53:49,686
So, here's the number.

1645
01:53:49,822 --> 01:53:52,359
You call that, and I'll
get back to you right away.

1646
01:53:54,117 --> 01:53:56,904
Yeah, you know,
I figured I'm just gonna...

1647
01:53:57,036 --> 01:54:00,369
put my money back on the table
and see what kind of cards I get.

1648
01:54:03,083 --> 01:54:05,455
You do what's in your heart, son.
You'll be fine.

1649
01:54:08,755 --> 01:54:10,462
Yeah.

1650
01:54:10,589 --> 01:54:12,665
- Thank you, Sean.
- Yeah.

1651
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:14,792
Thank you, Will.

1652
01:54:16,511 --> 01:54:19,761
Hey, does this violate the, uh,
patient-doctor relationship?

1653
01:54:19,889 --> 01:54:22,095
Nah. Only if you grab my ass.

1654
01:54:25,811 --> 01:54:28,017
- Take care.
- You, too.

1655
01:54:28,146 --> 01:54:30,019
Yeah.

1656
01:54:31,982 --> 01:54:33,856
Hey.

1657
01:54:33,984 --> 01:54:36,309
Good luck, son.

1658
01:54:47,454 --> 01:54:49,493
Two beers!

1659
01:54:53,751 --> 01:54:57,000
- What's up? Did you guys go?
- No. I had to talk him down.

1660
01:54:57,129 --> 01:54:58,753
Why didn't you yoke him?

1661
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:01,086
Uh, little Morgan's got
a lot of scrap to him.

1662
01:55:01,215 --> 01:55:04,382
You know, people try to whip his ass
every week. Fuckin' kid won't back down.

1663
01:55:04,510 --> 01:55:09,301
- What are you sayin' about me?
- Was I talkin' to you? Mind your fuckin' business.

1664
01:55:10,223 --> 01:55:12,630
- Go get me a beer.
- I ordered two beers.

1665
01:55:12,767 --> 01:55:14,925
- Hey, asshole.
- What, bitch?

1666
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:18,559
- Happy birthday.
- Thought we forgot, huh, bitch? Fuckin' come on.

1667
01:55:18,689 --> 01:55:21,724
- Come on. I got ya first.
- I'm goin'. I'm goin'.

1668
01:55:21,858 --> 01:55:23,981
- All right, who's first?
- Come on, motherfucker.

1669
01:55:24,110 --> 01:55:27,727
- All right. Who's first? Come on. Who's first?
- Oh, Danny boy

1670
01:55:27,863 --> 01:55:29,855
Here's your present.

1671
01:55:31,408 --> 01:55:32,950
- Come on, brother.
- What?

1672
01:55:33,076 --> 01:55:36,824
Well, we knew you had to get back and
forth to Cambridge for your new job.

1673
01:55:36,954 --> 01:55:41,532
And, anyway, I wasn't gonna
fuckin' drive you every day, so...

1674
01:55:41,666 --> 01:55:43,326
- Fuckin' can't be.
- Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.

1675
01:55:43,459 --> 01:55:45,701
That's not what I was sayin'.

1676
01:55:45,836 --> 01:55:48,161
But, uh, 21 now, so...

1677
01:55:48,297 --> 01:55:51,796
You're legally allowed to drink, so we
figured the best thing for you, kid, was a car.

1678
01:55:51,925 --> 01:55:54,250
- How do you like it?
- This is like...

1679
01:55:57,013 --> 01:56:01,057
This is the ugliest fuckin' car
I ever seen in my life.

1680
01:56:01,183 --> 01:56:04,302
- Come on, brother.
- How'd you guys do this?

1681
01:56:04,435 --> 01:56:06,677
You know, me and Bill
scraped together the parts...

1682
01:56:06,812 --> 01:56:10,146
and, uh, Morgan was out
panhandlin' for change every day.

1683
01:56:10,274 --> 01:56:13,440
- I had the router do all the bodywork.
- Yeah, I have a fuckin' job, too, brother.

1684
01:56:13,568 --> 01:56:16,652
Guy's been up my ass for two years about
a job. I had to let him help with the car.

1685
01:56:16,779 --> 01:56:18,238
So you finally got a job,
huh, Morgan?

1686
01:56:18,364 --> 01:56:20,440
Yeah, had one.
Now I'm fucked again.

1687
01:56:20,574 --> 01:56:23,740
- So what is it, a lawn mower? What do ya got?
- It's a straight fuckin' six.

1688
01:56:23,869 --> 01:56:25,908
Me and Bill rebuilt this engine
ourselves here.

1689
01:56:26,037 --> 01:56:29,121
It's a good car, dude.
The engine's good. Engine's good.

1690
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:33,539
- Happy 21, Will.
- Happy 21, brother.

1691
01:56:42,009 --> 01:56:43,918
Hi.

1692
01:56:44,052 --> 01:56:46,045
Come on in.

1693
01:56:48,723 --> 01:56:51,640
- Sean, I, um...
- Me, too, Gerry.

1694
01:56:53,185 --> 01:56:55,094
Yeah. Good.

1695
01:56:57,105 --> 01:56:58,813
- I heard you're takin' some time.
- Yeah.

1696
01:56:58,940 --> 01:57:03,067
I'll travel a little bit,
maybe write.

1697
01:57:03,193 --> 01:57:05,067
So where are you going?

1698
01:57:05,195 --> 01:57:09,109
India and China and Baltimore.

1699
01:57:10,867 --> 01:57:12,906
Oh.

1700
01:57:13,035 --> 01:57:18,455
- You know when you'll be back?
- Well, I got this flyer the other day.

1701
01:57:18,581 --> 01:57:21,535
It says, uh, class of '72
is having a reunion in six months.

1702
01:57:21,667 --> 01:57:23,541
Yeah, I got one of those, too.

1703
01:57:23,669 --> 01:57:25,412
Why don't you come?
I'll buy you a drink.

1704
01:57:26,296 --> 01:57:28,289
The drinks at those things are free.

1705
01:57:28,423 --> 01:57:31,957
I know, Gerry.
I was being ironical.

1706
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:38,717
Oh.

1707
01:57:38,848 --> 01:57:41,421
How about a drink right now?

1708
01:57:41,559 --> 01:57:43,302
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1709
01:57:43,436 --> 01:57:45,761
Come on. This one's on me.

1710
01:57:48,565 --> 01:57:50,688
- Got the winner right here, pal.
- Oh.

1711
01:57:50,817 --> 01:57:52,975
Yes, sir, this is the one.

1712
01:57:54,153 --> 01:57:56,644
This is my ticket to paradise.

1713
01:57:56,780 --> 01:57:58,654
Sean, do you know what the odds are
against winning the lottery?

1714
01:57:58,782 --> 01:58:01,818
- What, four to one?
- About 30 million to one.

1715
01:58:01,951 --> 01:58:05,900
- I still have a shot, you know?
- Yes, just about as big a chance...

1716
01:58:06,038 --> 01:58:08,992
as you being hit by lightning
here on the staircase right now.

1717
01:58:09,124 --> 01:58:10,867
Aw, that's a possibility, too, Gerry.

1718
01:58:11,001 --> 01:58:13,372
- I mean, 32 million. If you look at the size...
- Sean!

1719
01:59:42,828 --> 01:59:45,235
Will!

1720
02:00:04,179 --> 02:00:06,088
Will?

1721
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:15,357
He's not there.

1722
02:01:32,421 --> 02:01:36,370
I'll fake it through the day

1723
02:01:36,507 --> 02:01:39,710
Sean, if the professor calls
about that job...

1724
02:01:39,843 --> 02:01:42,002
just tell him sorry.

1725
02:01:42,137 --> 02:01:45,340
I had to go see about a girl.
Will.

1726
02:01:47,850 --> 02:01:51,183
Son of a bitch.
He stole my line.

1727
02:01:54,981 --> 02:01:56,855
<i>With two tickets</i>

1728
02:01:56,983 --> 02:02:01,194
<i>Torn in half for LA</i>

1729
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:04,938
<i>With nothing to do</i>

1730
02:02:05,073 --> 02:02:08,358
<i>Do you miss me</i>

1731
02:02:08,493 --> 02:02:12,157
<i>Miss Misery</i>

1732
02:02:12,287 --> 02:02:15,490
<i>Like you say you do</i>

1733
02:02:17,876 --> 02:02:22,122
<i>I know you'd rather see me gone</i>

1734
02:02:22,254 --> 02:02:25,089
<i>Than to see me</i>

1735
02:02:25,215 --> 02:02:29,378
<i>The way that I am</i>

1736
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:34,255
<i>But I am in the life anyway</i>

1737
02:02:34,389 --> 02:02:37,224
<i>Next door</i>

1738
02:02:37,350 --> 02:02:41,513
<i>The TV's flashing blue</i>

1739
02:02:41,646 --> 02:02:45,228
<i>Frames on the wall</i>

1740
02:02:45,357 --> 02:02:48,227
<i>It's a comedy</i>

1741
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:50,850
<i>Of errors, you see</i>

1742
02:02:50,987 --> 02:02:55,778
<i>It's about taking a fall</i>

1743
02:02:58,201 --> 02:03:00,075
<i>To vanish</i>

1744
02:03:00,203 --> 02:03:04,366
<i>Into oblivion</i>

1745
02:03:04,498 --> 02:03:08,198
<i>It's easy to do</i>

1746
02:03:08,335 --> 02:03:11,086
<i>And I try to be</i>

1747
02:03:11,212 --> 02:03:15,292
<i>But you know me
I come back</i>

1748
02:03:15,424 --> 02:03:19,670
<i>When you want me to</i>

1749
02:03:19,803 --> 02:03:23,218
<i>Do you miss me</i>

1750
02:03:23,347 --> 02:03:26,965
<i>Miss Misery</i>

1751
02:03:27,101 --> 02:03:30,599
<i>Like you say you do</i>

1752
02:03:46,033 --> 02:03:49,153
<i>Gonna find my baby
Gonna hold her tight</i>

1753
02:03:49,286 --> 02:03:52,868
<i>Gonna grab
some afternoon delight</i>

1754
02:03:52,997 --> 02:03:55,868
<i>My motto's always been
When it's right, it's right</i>

1755
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,499
<i>Why wait until the middle
of a cold, dark night</i>
